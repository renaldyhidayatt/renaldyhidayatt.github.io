## Problem Statement

The **Word Search** problem requires us to determine if a given word exists in an `m x n` grid of characters. The word must be constructed using sequentially adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically), and a cell cannot be reused more than once.

### Example:

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCCED"
Output: true
```

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "SEE"
Output: true
```

```
Input: board = [["A","B","C","E"],["S","F","C","S"],["A","D","E","E"]], word = "ABCB"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= m, n <= 6`
- `1 <= word.length <= 15`
- `board` and `word` consist only of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

## Approach

- Use **Backtracking** to explore all possible paths for the word.
- Utilize a **visited matrix** to prevent reusing the same cell.
- Perform **DFS** (Depth-First Search) on each cell, checking all four possible directions.

## Algorithm

1. Iterate through each cell in the board.
2. If the first character matches, start DFS.
3. During DFS, mark the cell as visited to avoid reuse.
4. Check all possible adjacent moves (up, down, left, right).
5. If a path is found that spells the word, return true.
6. Otherwise, backtrack and continue searching.
7. If no path is found for any starting point, return false.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func exist(board [][]byte, word string) bool {
    rows, cols := len(board), len(board[0])
    var dfs func(r, c, index int) bool
    
    dfs = func(r, c, index int) bool {
        if index == len(word) {
            return true
        }
        if r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= rows || c >= cols || board[r][c] != word[index] {
            return false
        }
        temp := board[r][c]
        board[r][c] = '#'
        found := dfs(r+1, c, index+1) || dfs(r-1, c, index+1) || dfs(r, c+1, index+1) || dfs(r, c-1, index+1)
        board[r][c] = temp
        return found
    }
    
    for i := 0; i < rows; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < cols; j++ {
            if dfs(i, j, 0) {
                return true
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}

func main() {
    board := [][]byte{{'A','B','C','E'},{'S','F','C','S'},{'A','D','E','E'}}
    word := "ABCCED"
    fmt.Println(exist(board, word))
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class WordSearch {
    public boolean exist(char[][] board, String word) {
        int rows = board.length, cols = board[0].length;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (dfs(board, word, i, j, 0)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(char[][] board, String word, int r, int c, int index) {
        if (index == word.length()) {
            return true;
        }
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= board.length || c >= board[0].length || board[r][c] != word.charAt(index)) {
            return false;
        }
        char temp = board[r][c];
        board[r][c] = '#';
        boolean found = dfs(board, word, r+1, c, index+1) || 
                        dfs(board, word, r-1, c, index+1) || 
                        dfs(board, word, r, c+1, index+1) || 
                        dfs(board, word, r, c-1, index+1);
        board[r][c] = temp;
        return found;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WordSearch ws = new WordSearch();
        char[][] board = {{'A','B','C','E'},{'S','F','C','S'},{'A','D','E','E'}};
        System.out.println(ws.exist(board, "ABCCED"));
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Backtracking Approach**: Tries all possible paths recursively.
- **Visited State Management**: Uses a temporary marker to track visited cells.
- **Base Case**: When the entire word is matched, return true.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n * 4^k)`, where `k` is the word length.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`, due to recursion depth.

## Conclusion

This solution efficiently determines if a word can be formed using backtracking and DFS with pruning for optimization.

## Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
```
**Output:**
```
4
```
**Explanation:** The longest consecutive elements sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
```
**Output:**
```
9
```

### Constraints:

- `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Approach

We can solve this problem efficiently using a **hash set**.

## Algorithm

1. Insert all numbers into a **hash set** for quick lookup.
2. Iterate through the numbers:
   - If a number is the **start** of a sequence (i.e., `num - 1` is not in the set),
   - Start counting the consecutive sequence.
3. Keep track of the longest sequence found.
4. Return the maximum length.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func longestConsecutive(nums []int) int {
    numSet := make(map[int]bool)
    for _, num := range nums {
        numSet[num] = true
    }
    
    longest := 0
    for num := range numSet {
        if !numSet[num-1] {
            currentNum := num
            currentStreak := 1
            
            for numSet[currentNum+1] {
                currentNum++
                currentStreak++
            }
            
            if currentStreak > longest {
                longest = currentStreak
            }
        }
    }
    return longest
}

func main() {
    nums := []int{100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2}
    fmt.Println(longestConsecutive(nums))
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> numSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            numSet.add(num);
        }
        
        int longest = 0;
        for (int num : numSet) {
            if (!numSet.contains(num - 1)) {
                int currentNum = num;
                int currentStreak = 1;
                
                while (numSet.contains(currentNum + 1)) {
                    currentNum++;
                    currentStreak++;
                }
                
                longest = Math.max(longest, currentStreak);
            }
        }
        return longest;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- We use a **hash set** to store numbers for `O(1)` lookup.
- We iterate over the set and find the start of a sequence.
- We count the length of each sequence and keep track of the longest one.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, since each number is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, due to storing numbers in a hash set.

## Conclusion

The **Longest Consecutive Sequence** problem can be efficiently solved using **hash sets** for `O(n)` complexity. ðŸš€

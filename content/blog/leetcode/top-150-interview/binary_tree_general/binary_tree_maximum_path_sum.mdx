## Problem Statement

A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 10^4]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Approach

1. Use a depth-first search (DFS) approach.
2. At each node, calculate the maximum sum of a path passing through that node.
3. Maintain a global maximum sum variable to track the highest path sum encountered.
4. Return the highest possible path sum from the left or right subtree plus the current node value.

## Algorithm

1. If `root` is `nil`, return `0`.
2. Perform DFS on the left and right subtrees.
3. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.
4. Return the highest sum of either left or right subtree plus the node's value.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

type TreeNode struct {
    Val   int
    Left  *TreeNode
    Right *TreeNode
}

func maxPathSum(root *TreeNode) int {
    maxSum := -1001
    
    var dfs func(*TreeNode) int
    dfs = func(node *TreeNode) int {
        if node == nil {
            return 0
        }
        
        left := max(0, dfs(node.Left))
        right := max(0, dfs(node.Right))
        
        maxSum = max(maxSum, left + right + node.Val)
        
        return max(left, right) + node.Val
    }
    
    dfs(root)
    return maxSum
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class MaxPathSum {
    private int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        int left = Math.max(0, dfs(node.left));
        int right = Math.max(0, dfs(node.right));
        
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, left + right + node.val);
        
        return Math.max(left, right) + node.val;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The algorithm uses DFS to traverse the tree.
- At each node, the left and right subtree sums are calculated.
- The maximum path sum is updated if the sum of the left subtree, right subtree, and the current node is greater than the previous maximum.
- The function returns the highest single branch sum (either left or right subtree plus node value) to propagate up the recursion.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree (recursion depth).

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently calculates the maximum path sum in a binary tree using DFS traversal and dynamic programming.

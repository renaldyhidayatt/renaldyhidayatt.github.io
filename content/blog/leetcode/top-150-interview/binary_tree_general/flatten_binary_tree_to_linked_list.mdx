## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always `null`.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order traversal of the binary tree.

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Follow-up: Can you flatten the tree in-place (with O(1) extra space)?

## Approach

1. Use a recursive approach or Morris traversal to flatten the tree.
2. Modify the tree in-place by reassigning right pointers.
3. Use a stack or track the rightmost node to reconstruct the linked list order.

## Algorithm

1. If `root` is `nil`, return.
2. Recursively flatten the left and right subtrees.
3. Store the right subtree.
4. Move the left subtree to the right and update pointers.
5. Attach the stored right subtree at the end.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

type TreeNode struct {
    Val   int
    Left  *TreeNode
    Right *TreeNode
}

func flatten(root *TreeNode) {
    if root == nil {
        return
    }
    
    flatten(root.Left)
    flatten(root.Right)
    
    temp := root.Right
    root.Right = root.Left
    root.Left = nil
    
    cur := root
    for cur.Right != nil {
        cur = cur.Right
    }
    cur.Right = temp
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class FlattenBinaryTree {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        
        flatten(root.left);
        flatten(root.right);
        
        TreeNode temp = root.right;
        root.right = root.left;
        root.left = null;
        
        TreeNode cur = root;
        while (cur.right != null) {
            cur = cur.right;
        }
        cur.right = temp;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The algorithm recursively processes the left and right subtrees.
- The left subtree is moved to the right.
- The original right subtree is attached at the end.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as the tree is modified in place.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently flattens a binary tree into a linked list with in-place modifications.

## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree:

```go
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each `next` pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `NULL`.

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 6000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Follow-up: You may only use constant extra space.

## Approach

1. Use a queue for level-order traversal.
2. Connect nodes at the same level using the `next` pointer.
3. Use a dummy node to manage `next` connections efficiently.
4. Ensure `O(1)` space complexity by modifying pointers in place.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a queue with the root node.
2. Iterate level by level, connecting nodes.
3. Use a dummy node to track the head of each level.
4. Assign `next` pointers correctly.
5. Move to the next level until all nodes are processed.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

type Node struct {
    Val   int
    Left  *Node
    Right *Node
    Next  *Node
}

func connect(root *Node) *Node {
    if root == nil {
        return nil
    }
    
    dummy := &Node{}
    cur := root
    
    for cur != nil {
        temp := dummy
        for cur != nil {
            if cur.Left != nil {
                temp.Next = cur.Left
                temp = temp.Next
            }
            if cur.Right != nil {
                temp.Next = cur.Right
                temp = temp.Next
            }
            cur = cur.Next
        }
        cur = dummy.Next
        dummy.Next = nil
    }
    return root
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Node {
    int val;
    Node left;
    Node right;
    Node next;
    
    Node(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class PopulateNextPointer {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        
        Node dummy = new Node(0);
        Node cur = root;
        
        while (cur != null) {
            Node temp = dummy;
            while (cur != null) {
                if (cur.left != null) {
                    temp.next = cur.left;
                    temp = temp.next;
                }
                if (cur.right != null) {
                    temp.next = cur.right;
                    temp = temp.next;
                }
                cur = cur.next;
            }
            cur = dummy.next;
            dummy.next = null;
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The algorithm traverses the tree level by level.
- A dummy node is used to track the start of each level.
- Nodes are connected efficiently using the `next` pointer.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as only pointers are modified.

## Conclusion

This problem demonstrates an efficient way to connect nodes in a binary tree with constant space complexity.

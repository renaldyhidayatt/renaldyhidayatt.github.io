## Problem Statement

Given the root of a **complete binary tree**, return the number of nodes in the tree.

A **complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4`
- The tree is guaranteed to be complete.

## Approach

- Use a **binary search approach** to count nodes efficiently.
- Compute the depth of the tree.
- Use binary search to check the existence of nodes in the last level.

## Algorithm

1. Compute the tree depth.
2. Use binary search to count nodes in the last level.
3. Return the total number of nodes.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "math"

type TreeNode struct {
    Val   int
    Left  *TreeNode
    Right *TreeNode
}

func countNodes(root *TreeNode) int {
    if root == nil {
        return 0
    }
    leftDepth := getDepth(root.Left)
    rightDepth := getDepth(root.Right)
    
    if leftDepth == rightDepth {
        return (1 << leftDepth) + countNodes(root.Right)
    } else {
        return (1 << rightDepth) + countNodes(root.Left)
    }
}

func getDepth(node *TreeNode) int {
    depth := 0
    for node != nil {
        depth++
        node = node.Left
    }
    return depth
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int leftDepth = getDepth(root.left);
        int rightDepth = getDepth(root.right);
        
        if (leftDepth == rightDepth) {
            return (1 << leftDepth) + countNodes(root.right);
        } else {
            return (1 << rightDepth) + countNodes(root.left);
        }
    }
    
    private int getDepth(TreeNode node) {
        int depth = 0;
        while (node != null) {
            depth++;
            node = node.left;
        }
        return depth;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The algorithm calculates the depth of the left and right subtrees.
- If they are equal, the left subtree is full, and we compute the right subtree recursively.
- If not, the right subtree is full, and we compute the left subtree recursively.
- This runs in `O(log n * log n)` complexity.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n * log n)` due to binary search.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(log n)` due to recursion.

## Conclusion

This solution efficiently counts nodes in a complete binary tree using binary search, ensuring better performance than `O(n)`. It leverages depth computation and recursive calls to minimize operations.

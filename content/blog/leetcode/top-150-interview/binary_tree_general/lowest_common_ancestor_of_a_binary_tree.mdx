## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of two given nodes in the tree.

The **lowest common ancestor** is defined as the lowest node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (including the node itself).

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
- All `Node.val` are unique.
- `p` and `q` will always exist in the tree.

## Approach

- Use a **recursive approach** to traverse the tree.
- If `p` or `q` is found, return the node.
- If both left and right subtrees return a non-null value, the current node is the LCA.
- Otherwise, return the non-null value from left or right subtree.

## Algorithm

1. Base case: If `root` is `nil`, return `nil`.
2. If `root` is equal to `p` or `q`, return `root`.
3. Recursively call `lowestCommonAncestor` on left and right subtrees.
4. If both calls return a non-null value, return `root`.
5. Otherwise, return the non-null value.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

type TreeNode struct {
    Val   int
    Left  *TreeNode
    Right *TreeNode
}

func lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode {
    if root == nil || root == p || root == q {
        return root
    }
    
    left := lowestCommonAncestor(root.Left, p, q)
    right := lowestCommonAncestor(root.Right, p, q)
    
    if left != nil && right != nil {
        return root
    }
    
    if left != nil {
        return left
    }
    return right
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null || root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }
        
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        
        if (left != null && right != null) {
            return root;
        }
        
        return (left != null) ? left : right;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The function traverses the tree recursively.
- If `p` or `q` is found at any node, return that node.
- If both left and right subtrees contain `p` or `q`, then the current node is the LCA.
- If only one subtree contains `p` or `q`, return that subtree.
- The recursion ensures that the lowest ancestor is found first.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree (O(log n) for balanced trees, O(n) for skewed trees).

## Conclusion

This solution efficiently finds the **Lowest Common Ancestor** in a binary tree using recursion. It ensures correctness by leveraging the properties of binary trees and returning the lowest ancestor first.

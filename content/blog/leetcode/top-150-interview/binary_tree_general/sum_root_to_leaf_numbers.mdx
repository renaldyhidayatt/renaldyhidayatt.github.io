## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.
Return the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

### Example 1:

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: root = [4,9,0,5,1]
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.

## Approach

1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
2. Maintain a running sum representing the current number formed.
3. If a leaf node is reached, add the number to the total sum.
4. Recursively check left and right subtrees.

## Algorithm

1. If `root` is `nil`, return `0`.
2. Use DFS to traverse the tree, passing the accumulated number.
3. If a leaf node is reached, add the number to the result.
4. Recursively process left and right children.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

type TreeNode struct {
    Val   int
    Left  *TreeNode
    Right *TreeNode
}

func sumNumbers(root *TreeNode) int {
    return dfs(root, 0)
}

func dfs(node *TreeNode, currentSum int) int {
    if node == nil {
        return 0
    }
    
    currentSum = currentSum*10 + node.Val
    
    if node.Left == nil && node.Right == nil {
        return currentSum
    }
    
    return dfs(node.Left, currentSum) + dfs(node.Right, currentSum)
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class SumRootToLeaf {
    public int sumNumbers(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, 0);
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode node, int currentSum) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        currentSum = currentSum * 10 + node.val;
        
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            return currentSum;
        }
        
        return dfs(node.left, currentSum) + dfs(node.right, currentSum);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The algorithm uses DFS to traverse the tree and construct numbers from root to leaf.
- At each node, the current sum is updated by multiplying it by `10` and adding the node's value.
- When a leaf node is reached, the sum is added to the final result.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree (recursion depth).

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently calculates the sum of all root-to-leaf numbers using DFS traversal.

## Problem Statement

The **Single Number II** problem requires finding the unique number that appears exactly once in an array where every other number appears exactly three times.

### Example:

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- Each element appears exactly three times except for one.

## Approach

- Utilize **bitwise operations** to track the occurrences of bits across numbers.
- Maintain two variables (`ones` and `twos`) to keep track of bits appearing once and twice.
- Use bitwise manipulation to filter out numbers appearing three times.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize `ones = 0` and `twos = 0`.
2. Iterate through each number `num` in `nums`:
   - Update `ones` and `twos` using bitwise operations.
   - Mask bits appearing three times.
3. Return `ones` as the unique number.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func singleNumber(nums []int) int {
    ones, twos := 0, 0
    for _, num := range nums {
        ones = (ones ^ num) & ^twos
        twos = (twos ^ num) & ^ones
    }
    return ones
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(singleNumber([]int{2, 2, 3, 2}))   // Output: 3
    fmt.Println(singleNumber([]int{0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 99})) // Output: 99
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ones = 0, twos = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            ones = (ones ^ num) & ~twos;
            twos = (twos ^ num) & ~ones;
        }
        return ones;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Bitwise XOR (`^`)** helps track occurrences.
- **Bitwise AND (`&`)** filters bits to reset them when they appear three times.
- **Bitwise NOT (`~`)** ensures proper bitwise masking.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, as we iterate through `nums` once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we use only a few integer variables.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently finds the unique number in an array where all others appear three times, using only constant space and bitwise operations.

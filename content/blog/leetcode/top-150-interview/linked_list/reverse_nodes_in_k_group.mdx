## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the modified list.

- `k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list.
- If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, the remaining nodes should be left as is.
- The values of the nodes must not be altered; only the nodes themselves may be changed.

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2  
```

**Output:**

```
[2,1,4,3,5]  
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3  
```

**Output:**

```
[3,2,1,4,5]  
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Approach

We use an **iterative approach** and **recursive reversal technique** to reverse nodes in groups of `k`.

## Algorithm

1. Count the total number of nodes.
2. If there are at least `k` nodes, reverse the first `k` nodes.
3. Recursively call the function on the remaining nodes.
4. Connect the reversed portion with the next part.
5. If fewer than `k` nodes remain, return as is.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

type ListNode struct {
    Val  int
    Next *ListNode
}

func reverseKGroup(head *ListNode, k int) *ListNode {
    count := 0
    curr := head
    for count < k && curr != nil {
        curr = curr.Next
        count++
    }
    if count < k {
        return head
    }
    prev, curr := (*ListNode)(nil), head
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        temp := curr.Next
        curr.Next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = temp
    }
    head.Next = reverseKGroup(curr, k)
    return prev
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode curr = head;
        int count = 0;
        while (count < k && curr != null) {
            curr = curr.next;
            count++;
        }
        if (count < k) return head;
        
        ListNode prev = null;
        curr = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            ListNode temp = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = temp;
        }
        head.next = reverseKGroup(curr, k);
        return prev;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Recursive Reversal Approach:**
  - Count nodes and check if reversal is possible.
  - Reverse `k` nodes at a time.
  - Recursively process the remaining nodes.
  - Connect reversed sections properly.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the list.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n/k)`, due to recursive calls.

## Conclusion

The **Reverse Nodes in k-Group** problem can be efficiently solved using a **recursive approach with in-place swapping**, ensuring `O(n)` complexity. ðŸš€

## Problem Statement

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that the tail's `next` pointer is connected to. Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```  
head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1  
```
**Output:**
```  
true  
```
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```  
head = [1,2], pos = 0  
```
**Output:**
```  
true  
```
**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.

### Example 3:

**Input:**
```  
head = [1], pos = -1  
```
**Output:**
```  
false  
```
**Explanation:** There is no cycle in the linked list.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
- `pos` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked list.

## Approach

We use Floydâ€™s **Tortoise and Hare Algorithm** (Cycle Detection Algorithm):

1. Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`.
2. Move `slow` one step at a time, and `fast` two steps at a time.
3. If `fast` meets `slow`, there is a cycle.
4. If `fast` reaches the end (`nil`), there is no cycle.

This approach ensures `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize two pointers: `slow = head` and `fast = head`.
2. Traverse the list:
   - Move `slow` by one step.
   - Move `fast` by two steps.
   - If `slow == fast`, return `true` (cycle detected).
3. If `fast` or `fast.next` becomes `nil`, return `false` (no cycle).

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

type ListNode struct {
    Val  int
    Next *ListNode
}

func hasCycle(head *ListNode) bool {
    if head == nil || head.Next == nil {
        return false
    }
    slow, fast := head, head
    for fast != nil && fast.Next != nil {
        slow = slow.Next
        fast = fast.Next.Next
        if slow == fast {
            return true
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) {
        val = x;
        next = null;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public boolean hasCycle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return false;
        
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
            if (slow == fast) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Step 1:** Use two pointers (`slow` and `fast`).
- **Step 2:** Traverse the list with different speeds.
- **Step 3:** If `slow` meets `fast`, a cycle is present.
- **Step 4:** If `fast` reaches the end, no cycle exists.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, since we traverse the list at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we use only two pointers.

## Conclusion

The **Linked List Cycle** problem can be efficiently solved using **Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm**, ensuring `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space. ðŸš€

## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```
**Output:**
```
1
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Approach

We use **Depth-First Search (DFS)** or **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to traverse and mark visited islands.

- Iterate through each cell in the grid.
- If a `'1'` is found, perform a **DFS/BFS** to mark all connected lands as visited.
- Count the number of DFS/BFS calls, which represents the number of islands.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize an island counter.
2. Traverse the grid and when a `'1'` is found:
   - Increment the counter.
   - Call DFS/BFS to mark all connected lands.
3. Return the count.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func numIslands(grid [][]byte) int {
    if len(grid) == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    
    rows, cols := len(grid), len(grid[0])
    count := 0
    
    var dfs func(r, c int)
    dfs = func(r, c int) {
        if r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= rows || c >= cols || grid[r][c] == '0' {
            return
        }
        grid[r][c] = '0'
        dfs(r+1, c)
        dfs(r-1, c)
        dfs(r, c+1)
        dfs(r, c-1)
    }
    
    for r := 0; r < rows; r++ {
        for c := 0; c < cols; c++ {
            if grid[r][c] == '1' {
                count++
                dfs(r, c)
            }
        }
    }
    return count
}

func main() {
    grid := [][]byte{
        {'1', '1', '0', '0', '0'},
        {'1', '1', '0', '0', '0'},
        {'0', '0', '1', '0', '0'},
        {'0', '0', '0', '1', '1'},
    }
    fmt.Println(numIslands(grid)) // Output: 3
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        int rows = grid.length, cols = grid[0].length;
        
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == '1') {
                    count++;
                    dfs(grid, r, c);
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private void dfs(char[][] grid, int r, int c) {
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= grid.length || c >= grid[0].length || grid[r][c] == '0') {
            return;
        }
        grid[r][c] = '0';
        dfs(grid, r+1, c);
        dfs(grid, r-1, c);
        dfs(grid, r, c+1);
        dfs(grid, r, c-1);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **DFS** marks all connected land as visited to prevent duplicate counting.
- **BFS** can also be used with a queue to achieve similar results.
- Each DFS/BFS call marks one island completely.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, as we visit each cell once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, due to recursion stack in DFS or queue in BFS.

## Conclusion

The **Number of Islands** problem is efficiently solved using **DFS or BFS**, allowing us to count distinct islands in a 2D grid. üåäüèùÔ∏è

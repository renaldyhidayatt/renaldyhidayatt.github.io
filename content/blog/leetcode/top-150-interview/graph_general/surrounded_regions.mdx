## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` board containing letters `'X'` and `'O'`. Capture all regions that are completely surrounded by `'X'`.

### Example 1:

```
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is `'X'` or `'O'`.

## Approach

- Identify `'O'` regions connected to the **border** and mark them as safe.
- Convert remaining `'O'`s into `'X'`s (captured regions).
- Convert safe `'O'`s back to `'O'`.

## Algorithm

1. Use **DFS** or **BFS** to mark border-connected `'O'`s as safe.
2. Traverse the board:
   - Convert `'O'` to `'X'` (captured region).
   - Convert safe-marked `'O'` back to `'O'`.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

func solve(board [][]byte) {
    rows, cols := len(board), len(board[0])
    directions := [][]int{{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}}

    var dfs func(int, int)
    dfs = func(r, c int) {
        if r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= rows || c >= cols || board[r][c] != 'O' {
            return
        }
        board[r][c] = 'S' // Mark safe
        for _, d := range directions {
            dfs(r+d[0], c+d[1])
        }
    }

    for r := 0; r < rows; r++ {
        if board[r][0] == 'O' { dfs(r, 0) }
        if board[r][cols-1] == 'O' { dfs(r, cols-1) }
    }
    for c := 0; c < cols; c++ {
        if board[0][c] == 'O' { dfs(0, c) }
        if board[rows-1][c] == 'O' { dfs(rows-1, c) }
    }
    
    for r := 0; r < rows; r++ {
        for c := 0; c < cols; c++ {
            if board[r][c] == 'O' {
                board[r][c] = 'X'
            } else if board[r][c] == 'S' {
                board[r][c] = 'O'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        int rows = board.length, cols = board[0].length;
        int[][] directions = {{0,1}, {1,0}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}};

        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            dfs(board, r, 0);
            dfs(board, r, cols - 1);
        }
        for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            dfs(board, 0, c);
            dfs(board, rows - 1, c);
        }
        
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (board[r][c] == 'O') {
                    board[r][c] = 'X';
                } else if (board[r][c] == 'S') {
                    board[r][c] = 'O';
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] board, int r, int c) {
        if (r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= board.length || c >= board[0].length || board[r][c] != 'O') {
            return;
        }
        board[r][c] = 'S';
        dfs(board, r + 1, c);
        dfs(board, r - 1, c);
        dfs(board, r, c + 1);
        dfs(board, r, c - 1);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Step 1**: Use **DFS** to mark all `'O'`s connected to the border as safe.
- **Step 2**: Convert remaining `'O'`s into `'X'`s.
- **Step 3**: Restore safe `'O'`s.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, where `m` and `n` are the board dimensions.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` (recursive DFS stack or explicit queue for BFS).

## Conclusion

By identifying and preserving `'O'`s connected to the border, we efficiently capture surrounded regions in-place.

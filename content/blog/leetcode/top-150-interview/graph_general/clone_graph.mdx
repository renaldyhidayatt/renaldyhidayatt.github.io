## Problem Statement

Given a reference of a node in a **connected undirected graph**, return a **deep copy** (clone) of the graph.

Each node contains a value (`int`) and a list of its neighbors.

### Example 1:

```
Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: adjList = [[]]
Output: [[]]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`
- The graph is **connected** and **undirected**.

## Approach

- Use a **hash map** to track cloned nodes and avoid cycles.
- Perform **DFS or BFS** to clone the graph.

## Algorithm

1. If the input node is `nil`, return `nil`.
2. Use a map to store **original node -> cloned node**.
3. Perform DFS/BFS:
   - If a node is visited, return its clone.
   - Clone the node and recursively clone its neighbors.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main
type Node struct {
    Val       int
    Neighbors []*Node
}

func cloneGraph(node *Node) *Node {
    if node == nil {
        return nil
    }
    visited := make(map[*Node]*Node)
    return dfs(node, visited)
}

func dfs(node *Node, visited map[*Node]*Node) *Node {
    if n, found := visited[node]; found {
        return n
    }
    clone := &Node{Val: node.Val}
    visited[node] = clone
    for _, neighbor := range node.Neighbors {
        clone.Neighbors = append(clone.Neighbors, dfs(neighbor, visited))
    }
    return clone
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
    public Node() {
        val = 0;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    public Node(int _val, List<Node> _neighbors) {
        val = _val;
        neighbors = _neighbors;
    }
}

class Solution {
    private Map<Node, Node> visited = new HashMap<>();
    
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        if (node == null) return null;
        if (visited.containsKey(node)) return visited.get(node);
        
        Node clone = new Node(node.val);
        visited.put(node, clone);
        for (Node neighbor : node.neighbors) {
            clone.neighbors.add(cloneGraph(neighbor));
        }
        return clone;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Step 1**: Use a **hash map** to store visited nodes.
- **Step 2**: Perform **DFS** recursively to clone nodes.
- **Step 3**: Ensure each node is visited only once.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N + E)`, where `N` is nodes and `E` is edges.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` for the hash map and recursion stack.

## Conclusion

By using a **hash map** and **DFS**, we efficiently clone the entire graph while avoiding cycles.

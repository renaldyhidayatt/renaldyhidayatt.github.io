## Problem Statement

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is burst by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

### Example:

**Input:**

```
points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
```

**Output:**

```
2
```

**Input:**

```
points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
```

**Output:**

```
4
```

## Approach

1. Sort the balloons by their end coordinate.
2. Iterate through the sorted balloons and track the end of the current overlapping group.
3. If a balloon starts after the current arrow position, shoot a new arrow and update the arrow position.

## Algorithm

1. Sort `points` by their ending coordinates.
2. Initialize `arrows` as `1` and set `arrowPos` as the end of the first balloon.
3. Iterate through `points`:
   - If a balloon starts after `arrowPos`, increment `arrows` and update `arrowPos`.
4. Return `arrows`.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"
)

func findMinArrowShots(points [][]int) int {
    if len(points) == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    sort.Slice(points, func(i, j int) bool {
        return points[i][1] < points[j][1]
    })
    
    arrows := 1
    arrowPos := points[0][1]
    
    for _, p := range points {
        if p[0] > arrowPos {
            arrows++
            arrowPos = p[1]
        }
    }
    return arrows
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(findMinArrowShots([][]int{{10,16},{2,8},{1,6},{7,12}})) // Output: 2
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        if (points.length == 0) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(points, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        
        int arrows = 1;
        int arrowPos = points[0][1];
        
        for (int[] p : points) {
            if (p[0] > arrowPos) {
                arrows++;
                arrowPos = p[1];
            }
        }
        return arrows;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- Sorting ensures that we always consider balloons in increasing order of their end coordinates.
- We use a greedy approach to minimize the number of arrows by tracking when the next arrow should be shot.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`, due to sorting.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we use only a few extra variables.

## Conclusion

This greedy algorithm effectively finds the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons. ðŸš€

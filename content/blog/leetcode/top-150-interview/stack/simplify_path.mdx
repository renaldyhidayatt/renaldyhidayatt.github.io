## Problem Statement

You are given an absolute path for a Unix-style file system, which always begins with a slash `/`. Your task is to transform this absolute path into its simplified canonical path.

The rules of a Unix-style file system are as follows:

- A single period `.` represents the current directory.
- A double period `..` represents the previous/parent directory.
- Multiple consecutive slashes such as `//` and `///` are treated as a single slash `/`.
- Any sequence of periods that does not match the rules above should be treated as a valid directory or file name.

The simplified canonical path should follow these rules:

- The path must start with a single slash `/`.
- Directories within the path must be separated by exactly one slash `/`.
- The path must not end with a slash, unless it is the root directory.
- The path must not have any single or double periods (`.` and `..`) used to denote current or parent directories.

Return the simplified canonical path.

### Example:

**Input:**

```
path = "/home/"
```

**Output:**

```
"/home"
```

**Input:**

```
path = "/../"
```

**Output:**

```
"/"
```

## Approach

1. Split the path by `/` and process each part.
2. Use a stack to manage directory navigation.
3. Construct the simplified path from the stack.

## Algorithm

1. Split `path` by `/` and iterate through each component.
2. Use a stack to process valid directory names:
   - Ignore empty components or `.`.
   - Pop the stack for `..` if not empty.
   - Push valid directory names onto the stack.
3. Join the stack into a final canonical path.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func simplifyPath(path string) string {
    parts := strings.Split(path, "/")
    stack := []string{}
    
    for _, part := range parts {
        if part == "" || part == "." {
            continue
        }
        if part == ".." {
            if len(stack) > 0 {
                stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
            }
        } else {
            stack = append(stack, part)
        }
    }
    return "/" + strings.Join(stack, "/")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(simplifyPath("/home//foo/")) // Output: "/home/foo"
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public String simplifyPath(String path) {
        Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();
        String[] parts = path.split("/");
        
        for (String part : parts) {
            if (part.equals(".") || part.isEmpty()) continue;
            if (part.equals("..")) {
                if (!stack.isEmpty()) stack.pop();
            } else {
                stack.push(part);
            }
        }
        return "/" + String.join("/", stack);
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- Splitting ensures that each directory component is processed separately.
- The stack helps efficiently manage directory navigation.
- The result is a correctly formatted canonical path.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the path.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for the stack storage.

## Conclusion

This stack-based approach efficiently simplifies Unix-style file paths. ðŸš€

## Problem Statement

The **Game of Life** is a cellular automaton devised by **John Horton Conway** in 1970.

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live (1) or dead (0)**.
Each cell interacts with its **eight neighbors** (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules:

1. Any **live cell** with **fewer than two live neighbors** dies (underpopulation).
2. Any **live cell** with **two or three live neighbors** lives on to the next generation.
3. Any **live cell** with **more than three live neighbors** dies (overpopulation).
4. Any **dead cell** with **exactly three live neighbors** becomes a live cell (reproduction).

The **next state** of the board is determined by applying these rules **simultaneously** to all cells.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
```
**Output:**
```
[[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
```

## Approach

1. Traverse the board and apply the Game of Life rules.
2. Use an **in-place** approach to avoid extra space by encoding states.
3. Update the board after all cells have been checked.

## Algorithm

1. Iterate through each cell and count its **live neighbors**.
2. Use **temporary markers**:
   - `-1` (was live, now dead)
   - `2` (was dead, now live)
3. Traverse again and update the board.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func gameOfLife(board [][]int) {
    m, n := len(board), len(board[0])
    directions := [][]int{{-1, -1}, {-1, 0}, {-1, 1}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}, {1, -1}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}}

    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            liveNeighbors := 0
            for _, d := range directions {
                r, c := i+d[0], j+d[1]
                if r >= 0 && r < m && c >= 0 && c < n && abs(board[r][c]) == 1 {
                    liveNeighbors++
                }
            }
            if board[i][j] == 1 && (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3) {
                board[i][j] = -1 
            } else if board[i][j] == 0 && liveNeighbors == 3 {
                board[i][j] = 2 
            }
        }
    }

    for i := 0; i < m; i++ {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            if board[i][j] == -1 {
                board[i][j] = 0
            } else if board[i][j] == 2 {
                board[i][j] = 1
            }
        }
    }
}

func abs(x int) int {
    if x < 0 {
        return -x
    }
    return x
}

func main() {
    board := [][]int{{0, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 1}, {0, 0, 0}}
    gameOfLife(board)
    fmt.Println(board)
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public void gameOfLife(int[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        int[][] directions = {{-1, -1}, {-1, 0}, {-1, 1}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}, {1, -1}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}};

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int liveNeighbors = 0;
                for (int[] d : directions) {
                    int r = i + d[0], c = j + d[1];
                    if (r >= 0 && r < m && c >= 0 && c < n && Math.abs(board[r][c]) == 1) {
                        liveNeighbors++;
                    }
                }
                if (board[i][j] == 1 && (liveNeighbors < 2 || liveNeighbors > 3)) {
                    board[i][j] = -1;
                } else if (board[i][j] == 0 && liveNeighbors == 3) {
                    board[i][j] = 2;
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == -1) {
                    board[i][j] = 0;
                } else if (board[i][j] == 2) {
                    board[i][j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Step 1:** Iterate through the board and mark cells for updates.
- **Step 2:** Use temporary values to avoid modifying cells prematurely.
- **Step 3:** Update the board based on encoded values.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, as each cell is processed twice.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since updates are done in-place.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently computes the next state of the board **in-place** using encoded values. ðŸš€

## Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` represents the price of a given stock on the `i`th day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

### Example:

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
```

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
```

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^5`

## Approach

- Use **dynamic programming** to keep track of **two transactions**.
- Maintain four states:
  - `buy1`: Max profit after first buy.
  - `sell1`: Max profit after first sell.
  - `buy2`: Max profit after second buy.
  - `sell2`: Max profit after second sell.
- Iterate through prices and update these states accordingly.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize `buy1`, `sell1`, `buy2`, `sell2`.
2. Iterate over `prices` and update these values.
3. Return `sell2` as the result.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
    buy1, sell1 := -1<<31, 0
    buy2, sell2 := -1<<31, 0
    
    for _, price := range prices {
        buy1 = max(buy1, -price)
        sell1 = max(sell1, buy1+price)
        buy2 = max(buy2, sell1-price)
        sell2 = max(sell2, buy2+price)
    }
    return sell2
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func main() {
    prices := []int{3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4}
    fmt.Println(maxProfit(prices)) // Output: 6
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int buy1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sell1 = 0;
        int buy2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, sell2 = 0;
        
        for (int price : prices) {
            buy1 = Math.max(buy1, -price);
            sell1 = Math.max(sell1, buy1 + price);
            buy2 = Math.max(buy2, sell1 - price);
            sell2 = Math.max(sell2, buy2 + price);
        }
        return sell2;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- The algorithm maintains four states representing two transactions.
- Each state is updated by evaluating the maximum possible profit at each step.
- Efficiently computes the solution in linear time.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, iterating through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, using constant extra space.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently determines the maximum profit achievable with at most two transactions using dynamic programming.

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most **one** share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it and immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the **maximum profit** you can achieve.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
```
**Output:**
```
7
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
```
**Output:**
```
4
```

## Approach

- **Greedy Approach:**
  - Buy when the price goes up and sell at every peak.
  - Accumulate profits over multiple transactions.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize `profit = 0`.
2. Iterate over the prices array:
   - If `prices[i] > prices[i - 1]`, add the difference to `profit`.
3. Return `profit`.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main
import "fmt"

func maxProfit(prices []int) int {
    profit := 0
    for i := 1; i < len(prices); i++ {
        if prices[i] > prices[i-1] {
            profit += prices[i] - prices[i-1]
        }
    }
    return profit
}

func main() {
    prices := []int{7,1,5,3,6,4}
    fmt.Println(maxProfit(prices)) // Output: 7
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class BestTimeToBuyAndSellStockII {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BestTimeToBuyAndSellStockII stock = new BestTimeToBuyAndSellStockII();
        int[] prices = {7,1,5,3,6,4};
        System.out.println(stock.maxProfit(prices)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Greedy Approach:** We simply add all upward price differences.
- **No extra space required:** We modify variables in-place.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, as we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since no extra space is used.

## Conclusion

The **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II** problem can be efficiently solved using a **Greedy Approach**, achieving `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity. ðŸš€

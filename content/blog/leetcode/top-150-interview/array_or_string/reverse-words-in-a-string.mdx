## Problem Statement

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
s = "the sky is blue"
```
**Output:**
```
"blue is sky the"
```

## Approach

1. Trim leading and trailing spaces.
2. Split the string into words.
3. Reverse the order of words.
4. Join the words with a single space.

## Algorithm

1. Trim spaces from the input string.
2. Split the string by spaces.
3. Reverse the array of words.
4. Join the words using a single space separator.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "strings"
)

func reverseWords(s string) string {
    words := strings.Fields(s)
    for i, j := 0, len(words)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
        words[i], words[j] = words[j], words[i]
    }
    return strings.Join(words, " ")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(reverseWords("the sky is blue")) // Output: "blue is sky the"
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
        StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            reversed.append(words[i]).append(" ");
        }
        return reversed.toString().trim();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.reverseWords("the sky is blue")); // Output: "blue is sky the"
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Trimming spaces:** Ensures no leading or trailing spaces.
- **Splitting words:** Extracts meaningful words.
- **Reversing words:** Reorders the extracted words.
- **Joining words:** Constructs the final reversed sentence.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, since we store the words separately before joining.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently reverses the words in a given string while ensuring proper formatting. ðŸš€

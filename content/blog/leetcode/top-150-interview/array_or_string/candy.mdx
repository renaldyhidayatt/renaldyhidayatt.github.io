## Problem Statement

You are given an array `ratings` where `ratings[i]` represents the rating of the `i`th child. 

You must distribute candies to these children according to the following rules:
- Each child must have at least **one** candy.
- A child with a **higher rating** than its adjacent neighbor must receive **more candies**.

Return the minimum number of candies needed to satisfy these conditions.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
ratings = [1,0,2]
```
**Output:**
```
5
```

**Input:**
```
ratings = [1,2,2]
```
**Output:**
```
4
```

## Approach

1. Use **two passes** to distribute candies efficiently.
2. Start with one candy for each child.
3. First pass (left to right): If a child has a higher rating than the previous one, give more candies.
4. Second pass (right to left): Adjust candies to maintain fairness while minimizing the total.

## Algorithm

1. Create an array `candies` initialized to `1` for each child.
2. Traverse from **left to right**, increasing candies for higher-rated children.
3. Traverse from **right to left**, ensuring fairness.
4. Sum up all values in `candies` array to get the result.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func candy(ratings []int) int {
    n := len(ratings)
    candies := make([]int, n)
    
    for i := range candies {
        candies[i] = 1
    }
    
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i-1] {
            candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1
        }
    }
    
    for i := n - 2; i >= 0; i-- {
        if ratings[i] > ratings[i+1] {
            candies[i] = max(candies[i], candies[i+1] + 1)
        }
    }
    
    sum := 0
    for _, c := range candies {
        sum += c
    }
    return sum
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func main() {
    ratings := []int{1,0,2}
    fmt.Println(candy(ratings)) // Output: 5
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] candies = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            candies[i] = 1;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]) {
                candies[i] = candies[i-1] + 1;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]) {
                candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i+1] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int c : candies) {
            sum += c;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] ratings = {1,0,2};
        System.out.println(sol.candy(ratings)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Two-pass approach:** Ensures fair and minimal candy distribution.
- **Guaranteed Optimal Solution:** Each child gets candies based on their rating relative to neighbors.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, since we traverse the list twice.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, using an extra array.

## Conclusion

Using a left-to-right and right-to-left pass ensures an optimal and fair candy distribution strategy. üç¨

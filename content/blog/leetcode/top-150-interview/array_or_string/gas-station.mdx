## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, where:
- `gas[i]` is the amount of gas at the `i`th station.
- `cost[i]` is the cost of gas to travel from station `i` to `i+1`.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can complete the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. The solution is guaranteed to be unique if it exists.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
gas = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
```
**Output:**
```
3
```

**Input:**
```
gas = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]
```
**Output:**
```
-1
```

## Approach

1. Calculate the **total gas balance**. If total gas is less than total cost, return `-1`.
2. If possible, find the **starting station** where the cumulative sum never goes negative.

## Algorithm

1. Compute `totalGas` and `totalCost`.
2. If `totalGas < totalCost`, return `-1`.
3. Iterate through the stations and track the **gas balance**.
4. If gas balance becomes negative, reset and start from the next station.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func canCompleteCircuit(gas []int, cost []int) int {
    totalGas, totalCost, start, tank := 0, 0, 0, 0
    
    for i := 0; i < len(gas); i++ {
        totalGas += gas[i]
        totalCost += cost[i]
        tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
        
        if tank < 0 {
            start = i + 1
            tank = 0
        }
    }
    
    if totalGas < totalCost {
        return -1
    }
    return start
}

func main() {
    gas := []int{1,2,3,4,5}
    cost := []int{3,4,5,1,2}
    fmt.Println(canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost)) // Output: 3
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int totalGas = 0, totalCost = 0, tank = 0, start = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i];
            
            if (tank < 0) {
                start = i + 1;
                tank = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return totalGas < totalCost ? -1 : start;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] gas = {1,2,3,4,5};
        int[] cost = {3,4,5,1,2};
        System.out.println(sol.canCompleteCircuit(gas, cost)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Tracking Gas Balance:** Reset starting index when running out of gas.
- **Guaranteed Unique Solution:** If a solution exists, the algorithm finds it efficiently.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, since we iterate through `gas` once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since only a few integer variables are used.

## Conclusion

By tracking cumulative gas balance and resetting the start index, we efficiently determine if the circuit can be completed. ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

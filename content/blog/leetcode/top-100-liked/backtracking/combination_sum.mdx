## Problem Statement

Given an array of distinct integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return a list of all unique combinations of `candidates` where the chosen numbers sum to `target`. You may return the combinations in any order.

The same number may be chosen from `candidates` an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if they contain different elements or a different frequency of elements.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than 150 combinations for the given input.

### Example 1:

**Input:** `candidates = [2,3,6,7]`, `target = 7`

**Output:** `[[2,2,3],[7]]`

**Explanation:**
- `2` and `3` are candidates, and `2 + 2 + 3 = 7`. Note that `2` can be used multiple times.
- `7` is a candidate, and `7 = 7`.
- These are the only two combinations.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `candidates = [2,3,5]`, `target = 8`

**Output:** `[[2,2,2,2],[2,3,3],[3,5]]`

### Example 3:

**Input:** `candidates = [2]`, `target = 1`

**Output:** `[]`

### Constraints:

- `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
- `2 <= candidates[i] <= 40`
- All elements of `candidates` are distinct.
- `1 <= target <= 40`

## Approach

We can solve this problem using **backtracking**. The idea is to explore each candidate while ensuring that we do not exceed the `target`. If a valid combination is found, we add it to the result list.

## Algorithm

1. Sort the candidates (optional but helps in pruning unnecessary paths).
2. Use a recursive function `backtrack` that takes the current combination, remaining target, and the start index.
3. If the remaining target is zero, add the combination to the result.
4. Iterate through the candidates, recursively calling `backtrack` with the updated target and current combination.
5. Ensure elements can be reused by not incrementing the index in the recursive call.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func combinationSum(candidates []int, target int) [][]int {
	var result [][]int
	var backtrack func([]int, int, int)

	backtrack = func(current []int, start int, remaining int) {
		if remaining == 0 {
			comb := make([]int, len(current))
			copy(comb, current)
			result = append(result, comb)
			return
		}
		for i := start; i < len(candidates); i++ {
			if remaining >= candidates[i] {
				backtrack(append(current, candidates[i]), i, remaining-candidates[i])
			}
		}
	}

	backtrack([]int{}, 0, target)
	return result
}

func main() {
	candidates := []int{2, 3, 6, 7}
	target := 7
	fmt.Println(combinationSum(candidates, target))
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CombinationSum {
    public List<List<Integer>> combinationSum(int[] candidates, int target) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(result, new ArrayList<>(), candidates, target, 0);
        return result;
    }

    private void backtrack(List<List<Integer>> result, List<Integer> current, int[] candidates, int remaining, int start) {
        if (remaining == 0) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
            return;
        }
        for (int i = start; i < candidates.length; i++) {
            if (remaining >= candidates[i]) {
                current.add(candidates[i]);
                backtrack(result, current, candidates, remaining - candidates[i], i);
                current.remove(current.size() - 1);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CombinationSum cs = new CombinationSum();
        int[] candidates = {2, 3, 6, 7};
        int target = 7;
        System.out.println(cs.combinationSum(candidates, target));
    }
}
```

## Explanation

The recursive function ensures that we generate all possible valid combinations by:
- Exploring each candidate while maintaining the remaining sum.
- Allowing repetition by keeping the index fixed in recursive calls.
- Backtracking when the target becomes zero or a candidate exceeds the remaining sum.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(2^T)`, where `T` is the target value.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(T)`, due to recursion depth and storing combinations.

## Conclusion

The backtracking approach efficiently finds all valid combinations while ensuring no duplicate subsets are considered. The Go and Java implementations leverage recursion to explore all possible solutions.

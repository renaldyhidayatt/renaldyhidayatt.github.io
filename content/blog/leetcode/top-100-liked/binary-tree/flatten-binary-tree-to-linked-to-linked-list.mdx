## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the left child pointer is always `null`.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a **preorder traversal** of the binary tree.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
```
**Output:**
```
[1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
root = []
```
**Output:**
```
[]
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**
```
root = [0]
```
**Output:**
```
[0]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Follow up:** Can you flatten the tree in-place (with `O(1)` extra space)?

## Approach

We can solve this problem using **Morris Traversal** (in-place) or using a **recursive approach**:

1. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Recursively flatten the left and right subtrees.
   - Attach the flattened left subtree to the right and append the flattened right subtree.

2. **Iterative Approach (O(1) Space):**
   - Use a pointer to traverse the tree.
   - If a node has a left subtree, find its predecessor (rightmost node of left subtree).
   - Attach the right subtree to the predecessorâ€™s right pointer.
   - Move the left subtree to the right and set left to `null`.

## Algorithm

### Recursive Solution:
1. Base case: If `root` is `nil`, return.
2. Recursively flatten `root.Left` and `root.Right`.
3. Store `root.Right` in a temporary variable.
4. Move `root.Left` to `root.Right`.
5. Traverse to the end of the new `root.Right` subtree and attach the stored `root.Right` subtree.
6. Set `root.Left = nil`.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type TreeNode struct {
    Val   int
    Left  *TreeNode
    Right *TreeNode
}

func flatten(root *TreeNode) {
    if root == nil {
        return
    }
    
    flatten(root.Left)
    flatten(root.Right)
    
    temp := root.Right
    root.Right = root.Left
    root.Left = nil
    
    curr := root
    for curr.Right != nil {
        curr = curr.Right
    }
    curr.Right = temp
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return;
        
        flatten(root.left);
        flatten(root.right);
        
        TreeNode temp = root.right;
        root.right = root.left;
        root.left = null;
        
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while (curr.right != null) {
            curr = curr.right;
        }
        curr.right = temp;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- Both implementations first flatten the left and right subtrees recursively.
- The left subtree is then moved to the right, and the right subtree is attached at the end.
- This ensures the tree follows preorder traversal order.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, since each node is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for recursive approach (due to recursion stack). The iterative approach reduces this to `O(1)`.

## Conclusion

The **Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List** problem can be solved using recursion or an iterative approach. The iterative approach provides an in-place solution with `O(1)` extra space. ðŸš€

## Problem Statement

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input:  l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]  
Output:  [7,0,8]  
Explanation:  342 + 465 = 807.
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input:  l1 = [0], l2 = [0]  
Output: [0]
```


### Example 3:

```plaintext
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]  
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

## Approach

We will use a linked list to simulate the addition of two numbers, digit by digit, from the least significant to the most significant (reverse order). At each step, we add the corresponding digits and carry, if any.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a dummy head node to simplify the process of building the result linked list.
2. Iterate over both linked lists simultaneously, adding corresponding digits and the carry.
3. If one linked list is shorter, treat missing nodes as zeros.
4. If there is a remaining carry after both linked lists are exhausted, add it as a new node.
5. Return the next node of the dummy head as the result linked list.

### Implementation in Go

Here is the Go implementation of the solution:

```go
// ListNode defines a linked list node
// AddTwoNumbers adds two numbers represented by two linked lists.
// Each linked list stores digits in reverse order, and the function
// returns the sum as a linked list, also in reverse order.
func AddTwoNumbers(l1 *ListNode, l2 *ListNode) *ListNode {
    // Create a dummy node to simplify the logic of appending nodes to the result list.
    head := &ListNode{Val: 0}
    
    // Initialize variables: 
    // - n1 and n2 are the digits from the two linked lists.
    // - carry holds any value that "carries over" to the next digit.
    // - current is a pointer used to build the result list.
    n1, n2, carry, current := 0, 0, 0, head

    // Continue looping while there are still nodes in either l1 or l2, 
    // or if there's still a carry to process (e.g., when adding two 9s).
    for l1 != nil || l2 != nil || carry != 0 {
        // Get the value from the current node of l1, if it exists. 
        // Otherwise, set n1 to 0.
        if l1 != nil {
            n1 = l1.Val
            l1 = l1.Next // Move to the next node in l1.
        } else {
            n1 = 0
        }

        // Get the value from the current node of l2, if it exists. 
        // Otherwise, set n2 to 0.
        if l2 != nil {
            n2 = l2.Val
            l2 = l2.Next // Move to the next node in l2.
        } else {
            n2 = 0
        }

        // Create a new node for the result linked list.
        // The value of this node is the sum of n1, n2, and carry, modulo 10.
        // This handles cases where the sum exceeds 9 (e.g., 5 + 6 = 11, so we store 1 and carry 1).
        current.Next = &ListNode{Val: (n1 + n2 + carry) % 10}
        
        // Move the current pointer to the next node in the result list.
        current = current.Next
        
        // Update the carry for the next iteration.
        // If the sum of n1, n2, and carry is 10 or greater, carry will be 1.
        // Otherwise, carry will be 0.
        carry = (n1 + n2 + carry) / 10
    }

    // Return the result linked list, starting from head.Next.
    // head is just a dummy node used to simplify the logic, so we skip it.
    return head.Next
}
```

### Implementation in Java

Here is the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
// Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class AddTwoNumbers {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        // Create a dummy node to simplify the logic of appending nodes to the result list.
        ListNode head = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode current = head;
        int carry = 0;

        // Continue looping while there are still nodes in either l1 or l2, 
        // or if there's still a carry to process.
        while (l1 != null || l2 != null || carry != 0) {
            int n1 = (l1 != null) ? l1.val : 0;
            int n2 = (l2 != null) ? l2.val : 0;

            // Create a new node for the result linked list.
            int sum = n1 + n2 + carry;
            carry = sum / 10; // Update the carry for the next iteration
            current.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);

            // Move the current pointer to the next node in the result list.
            current = current.next;

            // Move to the next nodes in the linked lists if they exist.
            if (l1 != null) l1 = l1.next;
            if (l2 != null) l2 = l2.next;
        }

        // Return the result linked list, starting from head.next.
        return head.next;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Typescript

Here is the Typescript implementation of the solution:


```typescript
// Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode {
    val: number;
    next: ListNode | null;

    constructor(val?: number, next?: ListNode | null) {
        this.val = (val === undefined ? 0 : val);
        this.next = (next === undefined ? null : next);
    }
}

class AddTwoNumbers {
    addTwoNumbers(l1: ListNode | null, l2: ListNode | null): ListNode | null {
        // Create a dummy node to simplify the logic of appending nodes to the result list.
        let head: ListNode = new ListNode(0);
        let current: ListNode = head;
        let carry: number = 0;

        // Continue looping while there are still nodes in either l1 or l2,
        // or if there's still a carry to process.
        while (l1 !== null || l2 !== null || carry !== 0) {
            const n1: number = (l1 !== null) ? l1.val : 0;
            const n2: number = (l2 !== null) ? l2.val : 0;

            // Create a new node for the result linked list.
            const sum: number = n1 + n2 + carry;
            carry = Math.floor(sum / 10); // Update the carry for the next iteration
            current.next = new ListNode(sum % 10);

            // Move the current pointer to the next node in the result list.
            current = current.next;

            // Move to the next nodes in the linked lists if they exist.
            if (l1 !== null) l1 = l1.next;
            if (l2 !== null) l2 = l2.next;
        }

        // Return the result linked list, starting from head.next.
        return head.next;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

Here is the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Create a dummy node to simplify the logic of appending nodes to the result list.
        head = ListNode(0)
        current = head
        carry = 0

        # Continue looping while there are still nodes in either l1 or l2, 
        # or if there's still a carry to process.
        while l1 or l2 or carry != 0:
            n1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            n2 = l2.val if l2 else 0

            # Create a new node for the result linked list.
            total = n1 + n2 + carry
            carry = total // 10  # Update the carry for the next iteration
            current.next = ListNode(total % 10)

            # Move the current pointer to the next node in the result list.
            current = current.next

            # Move to the next nodes in the linked lists if they exist.
            if l1:
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                l2 = l2.next

        # Return the result linked list, starting from head.next.
        return head.next
```

### Explanation
- Initialize Variables: We initialize a dummy head node, which simplifies appending new nodes to the result list. Variables n1, n2, and carry are used to store values from the linked lists and any carry-over during addition.
- Iterating Through Lists: We loop until all nodes in both lists are processed and the carry is zero. At each iteration, we extract values from the lists or use 0 if a list is exhausted. Then, we compute the sum and update the carry for the next iteration.
- Return the Result: After processing all digits, we return the result list starting from head.Next (since head is a dummy node).

### Time and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the maximum number of nodes in the two linked lists. We iterate through all nodes once.
- Space Complexity: O(n) as well, since we are creating a new linked list of size proportional to the input size.


## Conclusion
This solution demonstrates an efficient way to add two numbers represented as linked lists. By utilizing a dummy head node and handling the carry correctly, we can maintain a clean and readable implementation. The time and space complexity is linear, making this approach optimal for this problem.

## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, remove the `n`th node from the end of the list and return its head.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```  
head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2  
```
**Output:**
```  
[1,2,3,5]  
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```  
head = [1], n = 1  
```
**Output:**
```  
[]  
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**
```  
head = [1,2], n = 1  
```
**Output:**
```  
[1]  
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`

## Approach

We use **two pointers** to efficiently remove the `n`th node from the end in **one pass**.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both starting at the head.
2. Move `fast` pointer `n` steps ahead.
3. Move both pointers one step at a time until `fast` reaches the end.
4. The `slow` pointer is now just before the node to be removed.
5. Adjust the `next` pointer of `slow` to remove the target node.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

type ListNode struct {
    Val  int
    Next *ListNode
}

func removeNthFromEnd(head *ListNode, n int) *ListNode {
    dummy := &ListNode{Next: head}
    fast, slow := dummy, dummy
    
    for i := 0; i <= n; i++ {
        fast = fast.Next
    }
    
    for fast != nil {
        fast = fast.Next
        slow = slow.Next
    }
    
    slow.Next = slow.Next.Next
    return dummy.Next
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode fast = dummy, slow = dummy;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        while (fast != null) {
            fast = fast.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        
        slow.next = slow.next.next;
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        # Create a dummy node pointing to the head
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        fast = slow = dummy
        
        # Move the fast pointer n+1 steps ahead
        for _ in range(n + 1):
            fast = fast.next
        
        # Move both fast and slow pointers until fast reaches the end
        while fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        
        # Remove the nth node from the end
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        
        # Return the new head
        return dummy.next
```




## Explanation

- **Two Pointer Approach:**
  - Moves `fast` pointer `n` steps ahead.
  - Moves both pointers together until `fast` reaches the end.
  - Adjusts `slow.next` to skip the `n`th node from the end.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the list.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since only pointers are used.

## Conclusion

The **Remove Nth Node From End of List** problem can be efficiently solved using **two-pointer technique in one pass**, ensuring `O(n)` complexity. ðŸš€

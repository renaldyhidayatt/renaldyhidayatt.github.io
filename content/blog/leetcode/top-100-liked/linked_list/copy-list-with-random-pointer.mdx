## Problem Statement

A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional **random pointer**, which could point to any node in the list or `null`.

Construct a **deep copy** of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` brand new nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return the head of the copied linked list.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```  
head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]  
```
**Output:**
```  
[[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]  
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```  
head = [[1,1],[2,1]]  
```
**Output:**
```  
[[1,1],[2,1]]  
```

### Constraints:

- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
- `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.

## Approach

To solve this problem, we use an **interleaving technique**:

1. **First pass:** Create new nodes and insert them in between original nodes.
2. **Second pass:** Assign the `random` pointers for the new nodes.
3. **Third pass:** Separate the original and copied nodes to form the new list.

This approach ensures `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space.

## Algorithm

1. Iterate through the linked list and create a copy of each node, inserting it immediately after the original node.
2. Assign the `random` pointers of the copied nodes based on the original list.
3. Separate the new nodes from the original ones to form the deep copied list.
4. Return the head of the copied list.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

type Node struct {
    Val    int
    Next   *Node
    Random *Node
}

func copyRandomList(head *Node) *Node {
    if head == nil {
        return nil
    }
    
    curr := head
    for curr != nil {
        newNode := &Node{Val: curr.Val, Next: curr.Next}
        curr.Next = newNode
        curr = newNode.Next
    }
    
    curr = head
    for curr != nil {
        if curr.Random != nil {
            curr.Next.Random = curr.Random.Next
        }
        curr = curr.Next.Next
    }
    
    dummy := &Node{}
    newCurr, oldCurr := dummy, head
    for oldCurr != nil {
        newCurr.Next = oldCurr.Next
        oldCurr.Next = oldCurr.Next.Next
        oldCurr = oldCurr.Next
        newCurr = newCurr.Next
    }
    
    return dummy.Next
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Node {
    int val;
    Node next;
    Node random;
    
    public Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
        this.random = null;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        Node curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            Node newNode = new Node(curr.val);
            newNode.next = curr.next;
            curr.next = newNode;
            curr = newNode.next;
        }
        
        curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.random != null) {
                curr.next.random = curr.random.next;
            }
            curr = curr.next.next;
        }
        
        Node dummy = new Node(0);
        Node newCurr = dummy, oldCurr = head;
        while (oldCurr != null) {
            newCurr.next = oldCurr.next;
            oldCurr.next = oldCurr.next.next;
            oldCurr = oldCurr.next;
            newCurr = newCurr.next;
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- **Step 1:** Insert copied nodes between original nodes.
- **Step 2:** Assign `random` pointers correctly.
- **Step 3:** Separate the copied list from the original list.
- This approach ensures an **in-place deep copy** with `O(n)` time complexity.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, since we traverse the list three times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we do not use extra space apart from new nodes.

## Conclusion

The **Copy List with Random Pointer** problem can be efficiently solved using the **interleaving technique**. This ensures optimal `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space. ðŸš€

## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i-th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### Example 1:
**Input:** `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`

**Output:** `49`

**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water the container can contain is `49`.

### Example 2:
**Input:** `height = [1,1]`

**Output:** `1`

### Constraints:
- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Approach
We use a two-pointer approach to solve this problem efficiently.
- Place two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array.
- Calculate the area between the two pointers.
- Move the pointer that has the smaller height towards the other end.
- Repeat until the pointers meet.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize two pointers: `left = 0` and `right = n - 1`.
2. Set `max_area = 0`.
3. While `left < right`:
   - Compute the area: `area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)`.
   - Update `max_area` if `area` is greater.
   - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter height inwards.
4. Return `max_area`.

## Flowchart
```
Start -> Initialize left and right pointers -> While left < right
    -> Calculate area -> Update max_area if greater -> Move the smaller height pointer
    -> Repeat until left >= right -> Return max_area
```

## Implementations
### Implementation in Go
```go
func maxArea(height []int) int {
    left, right := 0, len(height)-1
    maxArea := 0
    
    for left < right {
        h := min(height[left], height[right])
        width := right - left
        maxArea = max(maxArea, h*width)
        
        if height[left] < height[right] {
            left++
        } else {
            right--
        }
    }
    return maxArea
}

func min(a, b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

### Implementation in Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int h = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
            int width = right - left;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, h * width);
            
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0

        while left < right:
            h = min(height[left], height[right])
            width = right - left
            max_area = max(max_area, h * width)

            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1

        return max_area

# Contoh penggunaan
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()
    height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
    print(solution.maxArea(height))  # Output: 49
```


## Explanation
- The key idea is to always maximize the width of the container while adjusting the height.
- By moving the pointer pointing to the smaller height, we give ourselves a chance to find a taller height that increases the area.
- This approach runs in `O(n)` time complexity, making it very efficient.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` since we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we use only a few extra variables.

## Conclusion
This problem demonstrates the power of the two-pointer technique for optimizing solutions that involve maximizing or minimizing values in a constrained space. The approach ensures efficiency with minimal extra space usage.

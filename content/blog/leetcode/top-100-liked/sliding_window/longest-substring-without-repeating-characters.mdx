## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
s = "abcabcbb"
```
**Output:**
```
3
```
**Explanation:** The answer is "abc", with the length of `3`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
s = "bbbbb"
```
**Output:**
```
1
```
**Explanation:** The answer is "b", with the length of `1`.

### Example 3:

**Input:**
```
s = "pwwkew"
```
**Output:**
```
3
```
**Explanation:** The answer is "wke", with the length of `3`. Notice that "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## Approach

We use the **Sliding Window** technique:

1. Maintain a hash set to store unique characters.
2. Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to define a window.
3. Expand `right` until a duplicate character is found.
4. Move `left` to remove characters until the substring is unique again.
5. Track the maximum length encountered.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a hash set to track unique characters.
2. Use a sliding window with `left` and `right` pointers.
3. Expand `right` until a duplicate character is found.
4. If a duplicate is found, move `left` to remove characters until unique.
5. Keep track of the maximum length of a substring found.
6. Return the maximum length.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

func lengthOfLongestSubstring(s string) int {
    charSet := make(map[byte]bool)
    left, maxLen := 0, 0
    
    for right := 0; right < len(s); right++ {
        for charSet[s[right]] {
            delete(charSet, s[left])
            left++
        }
        charSet[s[right]] = true
        maxLen = max(maxLen, right-left+1)
    }
    
    return maxLen
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class LongestSubstring {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        HashSet<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
        int left = 0, maxLen = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            while (charSet.contains(s.charAt(right))) {
                charSet.remove(s.charAt(left));
                left++;
            }
            charSet.add(s.charAt(right));
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
class LongestSubstring:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        charSet = set()
        left = 0
        maxLen = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s)):
            while s[right] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            charSet.add(s[right])
            maxLen = max(maxLen, right - left + 1)
        
        return maxLen

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    solver = LongestSubstring()
    print(solver.lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb"))  # Output: 3
```


## Explanation

1. **Step 1:** Start with two pointers (`left` and `right`) at the beginning.
2. **Step 2:** Expand `right` and add characters to the hash set.
3. **Step 3:** If a duplicate is found, move `left` until the substring becomes unique again.
4. **Step 4:** Update `maxLen` whenever a longer substring is found.
5. **Step 5:** Continue until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the string.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, as each character is processed at most twice (once by `right`, once by `left`).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(min(n, 128))`, as we store characters in a hash set, limited by the number of unique ASCII characters.

## Conclusion

The **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters** problem is efficiently solved using the **Sliding Window** technique, achieving `O(n)` time complexity with `O(1)` space complexity. ðŸš€

## Problem Statement


Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.

## Approach

We can solve this problem using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

## Implementation in Go

```go
func longestCommonSubsequence(text1 string, text2 string) int {
    m, n := len(text1), len(text2)
    dp := make([][]int, m+1)
    for i := range dp {
        dp[i] = make([]int, n+1)
    }
    
    for i := 1; i <= m; i++ {
        for j := 1; j <= n; j++ {
            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1] {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[m][n]
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

## Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int m = text1.length(), n = text2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (text1.charAt(i - 1) == text2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
        return dp[m][n]
```



## Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We maintain a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence between `text1[0:i]` and `text2[0:j]`.
2. **Transition Formula**:
   - If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
   - Else, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
3. **Final Result**: The length of the longest common subsequence is stored in `dp[m][n]`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, since we iterate through a `m x n` grid.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, due to the `dp` table.

## Conclusion

Using **Dynamic Programming**, we efficiently compute the length of the longest common subsequence between two given strings.

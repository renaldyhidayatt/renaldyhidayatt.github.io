## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return the **fewest number of coins** that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money **cannot** be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an **infinite number** of each kind of coin.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
```
**Output:**
```
3
```
**Explanation:** 11 = 5 + 5 + 1

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
coins = [2], amount = 3
```
**Output:**
```
-1
```

### Example 3:

**Input:**
```
coins = [1], amount = 0
```
**Output:**
```
0
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 10^4`

## Approach

We use **Dynamic Programming (DP)** to solve this problem efficiently.

- Define `dp[i]` as the minimum number of coins needed to make up amount `i`.
- Initialize `dp[0] = 0` (base case: 0 coins to make amount 0), and set all other values to `amount + 1` (impossible state).
- Iterate through each amount from `1` to `amount` and for each coin, update `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)`.

## Algorithm

1. Initialize a `dp` array of size `amount + 1` with all values set to `amount + 1`, except `dp[0] = 0`.
2. Iterate through each `coin` in `coins` and update `dp[i]` for all amounts `i`.
3. Return `dp[amount]` if it's not `amount + 1`, otherwise return `-1`.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

func coinChange(coins []int, amount int) int {
    dp := make([]int, amount+1)
    for i := range dp {
        dp[i] = amount + 1
    }
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for _, coin := range coins {
        for i := coin; i <= amount; i++ {
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-coin]+1)
        }
    }
    
    if dp[amount] == amount+1 {
        return -1
    }
    return dp[amount]
}

func min(a, b int) int {
    if a < b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(coinChange([]int{1,2,5}, 11)) // Output: 3
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int coinChange(int[] coins, int amount) {
        int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, amount + 1);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[amount] == amount + 1 ? -1 : dp[amount];
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.coinChange(new int[]{1,2,5}, 11)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- We iterate through each `coin` and update the `dp` array for all amounts greater than or equal to `coin`.
- The `dp` array keeps track of the minimum number of coins needed for each amount.
- If `dp[amount]` is still `amount + 1`, it means no combination is possible, so return `-1`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * amount)`, where `n` is the number of coins and `amount` is the target value.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(amount)`, due to the `dp` array.

## Conclusion

The **Coin Change** problem is efficiently solved using **Dynamic Programming**, allowing us to determine the minimum number of coins required in `O(n * amount)` time. ðŸš€

# 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products

## Sql


### Problem Statement

The task is to identify products that are both low-fat and recyclable from a given dataset. The input is structured as a table with three columns:

1. **`product_id`**: Unique identifier for each product.
2. **`low_fats`**: ENUM type indicating whether the product is low-fat (`'Y'` for yes, `'N'` for no).
3. **`recyclable`**: ENUM type indicating whether the product is recyclable (`'Y'` for yes, `'N'` for no).

### Constraints

- Return only the `product_id` for products that satisfy both conditions (`low_fats = 'Y'` and `recyclable = 'Y'`).
- The result order does not matter.

### Example Input

```table
| product_id | low_fats | recyclable |
|------------|----------|------------|
| 0          | Y        | N          |
| 1          | Y        | Y          |
| 2          | N        | Y          |
| 3          | Y        | Y          |
| 4          | N        | N          |

```

### Sql Query

```sql
SELECT product_id
FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```


## No Sql(MongoDB)

In MongoDB, the equivalent query uses the ``find`` method to filter documents based on the required conditions.

### Example Dataset

```json
[
  { "product_id": 0, "low_fats": "Y", "recyclable": "N" },
  { "product_id": 1, "low_fats": "Y", "recyclable": "Y" },
  { "product_id": 2, "low_fats": "N", "recyclable": "Y" },
  { "product_id": 3, "low_fats": "Y", "recyclable": "Y" },
  { "product_id": 4, "low_fats": "N", "recyclable": "N" }
]
```

### MongoDB Query

```js
db.Products.find(
  { low_fats: "Y", recyclable: "Y" },
  { _id: 0, product_id: 1 }
);
```

### Explanation
{ low_fats: "Y", recyclable: "Y" }: Filters documents where low_fats and recyclable are both 'Y'.
{ _id: 0, product_id: 1 }: Projects only the product_id field in the output, excluding the default _id.

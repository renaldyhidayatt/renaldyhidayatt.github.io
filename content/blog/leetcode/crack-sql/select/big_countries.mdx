### Problem Statement

The task is to find the name, population, and area of **big countries**. A country is considered big if:

1. It has an area of at least **3 million km²** (i.e., `area >= 3000000`), OR
2. It has a population of at least **25 million** (i.e., `population >= 25000000`).

The input consists of a table with the following structure:

- **`name`**: The name of the country.
- **`continent`**: The continent to which the country belongs.
- **`area`**: The total area of the country in km².
- **`population`**: The total population of the country.
- **`gdp`**: The gross domestic product of the country.

### Constraints

- Return only the `name`, `population`, and `area` of the big countries.
- The result order does not matter.

### Example Input

```table
| name        | continent | area    | population | gdp          |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------|--------------|
| Afghanistan | Asia      | 652230  | 25500100   | 20343000000  |
| Albania     | Europe    | 28748   | 2831741    | 12960000000  |
| Algeria     | Africa    | 2381741 | 37100000   | 188681000000 |
| Andorra     | Europe    | 468     | 78115      | 3712000000   |
| Angola      | Africa    | 1246700 | 20609294   | 100990000000 |
```

### Example Output

```table
| name        | population | area    |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| Afghanistan | 25500100   | 652230  |
| Algeria     | 37100000   | 2381741 |
```


### SQL Implementation

To solve this in SQL, use the SELECT statement with a WHERE clause to filter rows based on the conditions for big countries.

### SQL Query

```sql
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

### Explanation
- ``area >= 3000000``: Filters countries with an area of at least 3 million km².
- ``population >= 25000000``: Filters countries with a population of at least 25 million.
- ``OR``: Ensures that either of the conditions is sufficient for a country to be included in the result.
- ``SELECT name, population, area``: Retrieves only the required columns for the output.

### NoSQL(MongoDB) Implementation

In MongoDB, use the find method with an $or operator to handle the two conditions for big countries.

### MongoDB Query

```javascript
db.world.find(
  {
    $or: [
      { area: { $gte: 3000000 } },
      { population: { $gte: 25000000 } }
    ]
  },
  { _id: 0, name: 1, population: 1, area: 1 }
);
```

### Explanation

1. ``$or``: Combines conditions to match documents where at least one condition is true.
  - ``{ area: { $gte: 3000000 } }``: Filters countries with an area of at least 3 million km².
  - ``{ population: { $gte: 25000000 } }``: Filters countries with a population of at least 25 million.
2. Projection:
- ``{ _id: 0, name: 1, population: 1, area: 1 }``: Includes only the name, population, and area fields in the result while excluding the default _id.

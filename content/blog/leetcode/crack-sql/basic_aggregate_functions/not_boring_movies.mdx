# ðŸŽ¬ Not Boring Movies

In this article, weâ€™ll walk through a simple SQL query to filter and sort movie records from a table named `Cinema`. The task is to **select movies with an odd-numbered ID** and a **description that is not `'boring'`**, then sort them by their `rating` in **descending order**.

## ðŸ§¾ Table Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE Cinema (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  movie VARCHAR,
  description VARCHAR,
  rating FLOAT
);
```

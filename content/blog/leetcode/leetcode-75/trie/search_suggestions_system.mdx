## Problem Statement


You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.

Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have a common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix, return the three lexicographically smallest products.

Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: products = ["mobile","mouse","moneypot","monitor","mousepad"], searchWord = "mouse"
Output: [["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mobile","moneypot","monitor"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"],["mouse","mousepad"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: products = ["havana"], searchWord = "havana"
Output: [["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"],["havana"]]
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`
- `1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 10^4`
- All the strings of `products` are unique.
- `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Approach

We use a **Trie** structure to efficiently store and retrieve words with a given prefix. Sorting the product list beforehand allows efficient retrieval of lexicographically smallest suggestions.

### Implementation in Go

```go
import (
    "sort"
)

func suggestedProducts(products []string, searchWord string) [][]string {
    sort.Strings(products)
    result := [][]string{}
    prefix := ""
    
    for _, ch := range searchWord {
        prefix += string(ch)
        suggestions := []string{}
        
        for _, product := range products {
            if len(suggestions) == 3 {
                break
            }
            if len(product) >= len(prefix) && product[:len(prefix)] == prefix {
                suggestions = append(suggestions, product)
            }
        }
        result = append(result, suggestions)
    }
    return result
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> suggestedProducts(String[] products, String searchWord) {
        Arrays.sort(products);
        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        String prefix = "";
        
        for (char ch : searchWord.toCharArray()) {
            prefix += ch;
            List<String> suggestions = new ArrayList<>();
            
            for (String product : products) {
                if (suggestions.size() == 3) {
                    break;
                }
                if (product.startsWith(prefix)) {
                    suggestions.add(product);
                }
            }
            result.add(suggestions);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
class Solution:
    def suggestedProducts(self, products, searchWord):
        products.sort()
        result = []
        prefix = ""
        
        for ch in searchWord:
            prefix += ch
            suggestions = []
            
            for product in products:
                if len(suggestions) == 3:
                    break
                if product.startswith(prefix):
                    suggestions.append(product)
            
            result.append(suggestions)
        
        return result

```


## Explanation

1. **Sorting Products:**
   - Sort the products lexicographically to ensure that the first three matches are always the smallest ones.

2. **Iterating Over SearchWord:**
   - Build the `prefix` character by character.
   - Find up to three products that start with this `prefix`.

3. **Storing Results:**
   - Append the found suggestions to the result list after each character input.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Sorting Products:** `O(M log M)` where `M` is the number of products.
- **Searching for Suggestions:** `O(N * M)`, where `N` is the length of `searchWord`, and `M` is the number of products.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `searchWord` (for storing results).

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently finds search suggestions while maintaining lexicographical order. The use of sorting and prefix search makes it an optimal solution for the problem. ðŸš€

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, perform the maximum number of operations where in each operation, you pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them.

Return the maximum number of operations that can be performed.

### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`, `k = 5`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:**
- Remove numbers `1` and `4`, then `nums = [2,3]`
- Remove numbers `2` and `3`, then `nums = []`
- No more pairs that sum up to `5`, hence a total of `2` operations.

### Example 2:
**Input:** `nums = [3,1,3,4,3]`, `k = 6`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:**
- Remove the first two `3`s, then `nums = [1,4,3]`
- No more pairs that sum up to `6`, hence a total of `1` operation.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Approach
We can solve this problem using a **hash map** or a **two-pointer** approach:

1. **Hash Map Approach:**
   - Use a hash map to count occurrences of each number.
   - Iterate through `nums`, checking if `k - num` exists in the map.
   - If found, decrease both counts and increase the operation count.
   
2. **Two-Pointer Approach (if sorted):**
   - Sort `nums`.
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to find pairs summing to `k`.
   - If the sum is equal to `k`, move both pointers.
   - If the sum is less than `k`, move `left` pointer.
   - If the sum is greater than `k`, move `right` pointer.
   
---

## Algorithm
**Using Hash Map:**
1. Initialize a hash map `freq` to store occurrences of numbers.
2. Initialize `operations = 0`.
3. Iterate through `nums`:
   - If `k - num` exists in `freq` (count > 0), form a pair, decrease counts, and increase `operations`.
   - Otherwise, increase `freq[num]`.
4. Return `operations`.

**Using Two Pointers:**
1. Sort `nums`.
2. Initialize `left = 0`, `right = len(nums) - 1`, and `operations = 0`.
3. While `left < right`:
   - If `nums[left] + nums[right] == k`, move both pointers and increase `operations`.
   - If sum is less than `k`, move `left`.
   - If sum is greater than `k`, move `right`.
4. Return `operations`.

## Implementations

### Implementation in Go
```go
func maxOperations(nums []int, k int) int {
    freq := make(map[int]int)
    operations := 0
    
    for _, num := range nums {
        if freq[k-num] > 0 {
            operations++
            freq[k-num]--
        } else {
            freq[num]++
        }
    }
    
    return operations
}
```

### Implementation in Java
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (freq.getOrDefault(k - num, 0) > 0) {
                operations++;
                freq.put(k - num, freq.get(k - num) - 1);
            } else {
                freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums, k: int) -> int:
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        operations = 0
        
        for num in nums:
            if freq[k - num] > 0:
                operations += 1
                freq[k - num] -= 1
            else:
                freq[num] += 1
        
        return operations

```

## Explanation
Both implementations iterate through `nums`, maintaining a count of seen numbers using a hash map. If the complement (`k - num`) exists, a pair is formed, and the operation count is increased.

## Time and Space Complexity
| Approach        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Hash Map       | O(n)          | O(n)          |
| Two Pointers   | O(n log n)    | O(1)          |

- The **hash map** approach works in O(n) time and O(n) space.
- The **two-pointer** approach requires sorting (O(n log n)) but uses O(1) space.

---

## Conclusion
We efficiently solved the problem using a hash map for O(n) complexity. Alternatively, a two-pointer approach is possible if sorting is allowed.

This method ensures optimal performance for large inputs.

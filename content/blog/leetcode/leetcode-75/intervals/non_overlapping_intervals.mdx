## Problem Statement


Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, `[1, 2]` and `[2, 3]` are non-overlapping.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^5`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-5 * 10^4 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10^4`

## Approach

We use a **greedy algorithm** to sort the intervals by their end time and keep track of overlapping intervals. By always selecting the interval with the earliest end time, we minimize the number of intervals to remove.

### Implementation in Go

```go
import "sort"

func eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals [][]int) int {
    if len(intervals) == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    
    sort.Slice(intervals, func(i, j int) bool {
        return intervals[i][1] < intervals[j][1]
    })
    
    count, end := 0, intervals[0][1]
    for i := 1; i < len(intervals); i++ {
        if intervals[i][0] < end {
            count++
        } else {
            end = intervals[i][1]
        }
    }
    return count
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) return 0;
        
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        
        int count = 0;
        int end = intervals[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < end) {
                count++;
            } else {
                end = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals):
        if not intervals:
            return 0

        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])

        count = 0
        end = intervals[0][1]

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] < end:
                count += 1
            else:
                end = intervals[i][1]

        return count

```


## Explanation

1. **Sort intervals by end time** to ensure that we always consider the interval that finishes first.
2. **Iterate through the intervals** while maintaining a variable `end` to track the last non-overlapping interval.
3. **If an interval overlaps** with the previous one (`intervals[i][0] < end`), we increment the removal count.
4. **If no overlap**, update `end` to the current intervalâ€™s end.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Sorting complexity:** `O(n log n)`
- **Traversal complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Overall complexity:** `O(n log n)`
- **Space complexity:** `O(1)` since we are sorting in-place.

## Conclusion

The **greedy approach** efficiently solves the problem by ensuring the minimum number of intervals are removed to make the remaining intervals non-overlapping. ðŸš€

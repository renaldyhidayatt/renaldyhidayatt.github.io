## Problem Statement


Given an array of points `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]`, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

Arrows can be shot directly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon is burst if its x-coordinate lies within the range `[xstart, xend]` of an arrow.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-2^31 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1`

## Approach

We use a **greedy algorithm** to sort the balloons by their end coordinate and keep track of overlapping intervals. By always shooting an arrow at the earliest possible position, we minimize the number of arrows required.

## Implementation in Go

```go
import "sort"

func findMinArrowShots(points [][]int) int {
    if len(points) == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    
    sort.Slice(points, func(i, j int) bool {
        return points[i][1] < points[j][1]
    })
    
    arrows, end := 1, points[0][1]
    for i := 1; i < len(points); i++ {
        if points[i][0] > end {
            arrows++
            end = points[i][1]
        }
    }
    return arrows
}
```

## Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        if (points.length == 0) return 0;
        
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        
        int arrows = 1;
        int end = points[0][1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
            if (points[i][0] > end) {
                arrows++;
                end = points[i][1];
            }
        }
        return arrows;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Sort balloons by end coordinate** to ensure that we always consider the balloon that ends first.
2. **Iterate through the balloons** while maintaining a variable `end` to track the last burst balloon.
3. **If a balloon starts after the previous end**, we need a new arrow and update `end`.
4. **Otherwise, the balloon is already burst by the current arrow**.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Sorting complexity:** `O(n log n)`
- **Traversal complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Overall complexity:** `O(n log n)`
- **Space complexity:** `O(1)` since we are sorting in-place.

## Conclusion

The **greedy approach** efficiently solves the problem by ensuring the minimum number of arrows are used to burst all balloons. ðŸš€

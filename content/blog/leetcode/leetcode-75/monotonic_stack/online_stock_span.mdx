## Problem Statement


Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
Output
[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= price <= 10^5`
- At most `10^4` calls will be made to `next`.

## Approach

We use a **monotonic stack** to keep track of stock prices and their spans.

### Implementation in Go

```go
type StockSpanner struct {
    stack [][2]int
}

func Constructor() StockSpanner {
    return StockSpanner{}
}

func (this *StockSpanner) Next(price int) int {
    span := 1
    for len(this.stack) > 0 && this.stack[len(this.stack)-1][0] <= price {
        span += this.stack[len(this.stack)-1][1]
        this.stack = this.stack[:len(this.stack)-1]
    }
    this.stack = append(this.stack, [2]int{price, span})
    return span
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class StockSpanner {
    private Stack<int[]> stack;

    public StockSpanner() {
        stack = new Stack<>();
    }

    public int next(int price) {
        int span = 1;
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek()[0] <= price) {
            span += stack.pop()[1];
        }
        stack.push(new int[]{price, span});
        return span;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
class StockSpanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def next(self, price: int) -> int:
        span = 1
        while self.stack and self.stack[-1][0] <= price:
            span += self.stack.pop()[1]
        self.stack.append((price, span))
        return span
```


## Explanation

1. **Use a stack** to store pairs of `(price, span)`.
2. **Iterate through the price stream**, popping elements when a higher price is encountered.
3. **Accumulate span values** for each popped element.
4. **Push the current price and its calculated span** onto the stack.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` since each price is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the stack in the worst case.

## Conclusion

The **monotonic stack** approach efficiently solves the problem in `O(n)`, making it suitable for large input sizes. ðŸš€

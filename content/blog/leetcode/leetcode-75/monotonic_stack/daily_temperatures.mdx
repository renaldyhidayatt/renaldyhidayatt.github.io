## Problem Statement


Given an array of integers `temperatures` representing the daily temperatures, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `i`-th day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep `answer[i] == 0`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5`
- `30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100`

## Approach

We use a **monotonic stack** to efficiently track temperatures and determine the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature.

## Implementation in Go

```go
func dailyTemperatures(temperatures []int) []int {
    n := len(temperatures)
    answer := make([]int, n)
    stack := []int{}
    
    for i, temp := range temperatures {
        for len(stack) > 0 && temperatures[stack[len(stack)-1]] < temp {
            idx := stack[len(stack)-1]
            stack = stack[:len(stack)-1]
            answer[idx] = i - idx
        }
        stack = append(stack, i)
    }
    return answer
}
```

## Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
        int n = temperatures.length;
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && temperatures[stack.peek()] < temperatures[i]) {
                int idx = stack.pop();
                answer[idx] = i - idx;
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        return answer;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Use a stack** to keep track of indices of temperature values.
2. **Iterate through the array** and for each temperature, check if it's greater than the temperature at the index stored on top of the stack.
3. **Pop elements from the stack** and calculate the waiting days when a warmer temperature is found.
4. **Push the current index** onto the stack for future comparisons.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` since each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the stack in the worst case.

## Conclusion

The **monotonic stack** approach allows us to efficiently solve the

## Problem Statement


In a linked list of size `n`, where `n` is even, the `i-th` node (0-indexed) of the linked list is the twin of the `(n-1-i)-th` node, if `0 <= i <= (n / 2) - 1`.

The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with an even length, return the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: head = [5,4,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 3 are twins, with twin sum 5 + 1 = 6.
Nodes 1 and 2 are twins, with twin sum 4 + 2 = 6.
Maximum twin sum = max(6, 6) = 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [4,2,2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
Nodes 0 and 3 are twins, with twin sum 4 + 3 = 7.
Nodes 1 and 2 are twins, with twin sum 2 + 2 = 4.
Maximum twin sum = max(7, 4) = 7.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: head = [1,100000]
Output: 100001
Explanation:
Only one pair exists: twin sum = 1 + 100000 = 100001.
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is an even integer in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Implementation in Go

```go
// Definition for singly-linked list.
type ListNode struct {
    Val  int
    Next *ListNode
}

func pairSum(head *ListNode) int {
    slow, fast := head, head
    var prev *ListNode
    
    // Find the middle of the list and reverse the first half
    for fast != nil && fast.Next != nil {
        fast = fast.Next.Next
        temp := slow.Next
        slow.Next = prev
        prev = slow
        slow = temp
    }
    
    maxSum := 0
    for slow != nil {
        maxSum = max(maxSum, prev.Val + slow.Val)
        prev = prev.Next
        slow = slow.Next
    }
    return maxSum
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

## Implementation in Java

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

class Solution {
    public int pairSum(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head, prev = null;
        
        // Find the middle and reverse the first half
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            ListNode temp = slow.next;
            slow.next = prev;
            prev = slow;
            slow = temp;
        }
        
        int maxSum = 0;
        while (slow != null) {
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, prev.val + slow.val);
            prev = prev.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently finds the maximum twin sum in a linked list by using a two-pointer technique to split and reverse half of the list. The solution runs in `O(n)` time complexity and uses `O(1)` extra space.

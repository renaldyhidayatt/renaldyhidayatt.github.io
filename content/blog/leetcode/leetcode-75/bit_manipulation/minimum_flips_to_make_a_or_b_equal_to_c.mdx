## Problem Statement


Given 3 positive numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the minimum flips required in some bits of `a` and `b` to make `(a OR b == c)`. A flip operation consists of changing any single bit `1` to `0` or `0` to `1` in their binary representation.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: After flips a = 1, b = 4, c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= a, b, c <= 10^9`

## Approach

We analyze the bits of `a`, `b`, and `c` one by one:
- If `c` has a `1` in a position, at least one of `a` or `b` must have `1`.
- If `c` has a `0`, both `a` and `b` must be `0`, requiring flips if they aren't.


### Implementation in Go

```go
func minFlips(a int, b int, c int) int {
    flips := 0
    for i := 0; i < 32; i++ {
        bitA := (a >> i) & 1
        bitB := (b >> i) & 1
        bitC := (c >> i) & 1
        
        if bitC == 0 {
            flips += bitA + bitB
        } else {
            if bitA == 0 && bitB == 0 {
                flips++
            }
        }
    }
    return flips
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
        int flips = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            int bitA = (a >> i) & 1;
            int bitB = (b >> i) & 1;
            int bitC = (c >> i) & 1;
            
            if (bitC == 0) {
                flips += bitA + bitB;
            } else {
                if (bitA == 0 && bitB == 0) {
                    flips++;
                }
            }
        }
        return flips;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python
```python
class Solution:
    def minFlips(self, a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
        flips = 0
        for i in range(32):
            bitA = (a >> i) & 1
            bitB = (b >> i) & 1
            bitC = (c >> i) & 1

            if bitC == 0:
                flips += bitA + bitB
            else:
                if bitA == 0 and bitB == 0:
                    flips += 1
        return flips
```

## Explanation

1. **Bitwise operations** allow us to check each bit position independently.
2. We iterate through all 32 bits (assuming 32-bit integers).
3. If `c` has `0`, both `a` and `b` must be `0`, requiring flips if they're not.
4. If `c` has `1`, at least one of `a` or `b` must be `1`, requiring a flip if neither is `1`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we iterate through at most 32 bits.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we use only a few extra variables.

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently determines the minimum flips needed to match `c` using bitwise operations in constant time and space.

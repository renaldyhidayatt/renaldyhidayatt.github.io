## Problem Statement


There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and all the rooms are locked except for room `0`. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`, return `true` if you can visit all the rooms, or `false` otherwise.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

- `n == rooms.length`
- `2 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000`
- `1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000`
- `0 <= rooms[i][j] < n`
- All the values of `rooms[i]` are unique.

## Implementation in Go

```go
func canVisitAllRooms(rooms [][]int) bool {
    visited := make([]bool, len(rooms))
    var dfs func(int)
    dfs = func(room int) {
        if visited[room] {
            return
        }
        visited[room] = true
        for _, key := range rooms[room] {
            dfs(key)
        }
    }
    
    dfs(0)
    
    for _, v := range visited {
        if !v {
            return false
        }
    }
    return true
}
```

## Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean canVisitAllRooms(List<List<Integer>> rooms) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[rooms.size()];
        dfs(0, rooms, visited);
        
        for (boolean v : visited) {
            if (!v) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int room, List<List<Integer>> rooms, boolean[] visited) {
        if (visited[room]) return;
        visited[room] = true;
        for (int key : rooms.get(room)) {
            dfs(key, rooms, visited);
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This problem can be solved using **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. The idea is to start from room `0`, mark it as visited, and then recursively visit all reachable rooms using the keys found. If all rooms are visited, return `true`, otherwise return `false`. The time complexity of this approach is `O(n + E)`, where `n` is the number of rooms and `E` is the total number of keys in all rooms.

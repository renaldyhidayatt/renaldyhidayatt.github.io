## Problem Statement


There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `i-th` city and `j-th` city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return the total number of **provinces**.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 200`
- `n == isConnected.length`
- `n == isConnected[i].length`
- `isConnected[i][j]` is `1` or `0`.
- `isConnected[i][i] == 1`
- `isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]`

## Implementation in Go

```go
func findCircleNum(isConnected [][]int) int {
    n := len(isConnected)
    visited := make([]bool, n)
    count := 0

    var dfs func(int)
    dfs = func(i int) {
        for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
            if isConnected[i][j] == 1 && !visited[j] {
                visited[j] = true
                dfs(j)
            }
        }
    }

    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        if !visited[i] {
            count++
            visited[i] = true
            dfs(i)
        }
    }

    return count
}
```

## Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] isConnected) {
        int n = isConnected.length;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                count++;
                dfs(isConnected, visited, i);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int[][] isConnected, boolean[] visited, int i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < isConnected.length; j++) {
            if (isConnected[i][j] == 1 && !visited[j]) {
                visited[j] = true;
                dfs(isConnected, visited, j);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This problem can be solved using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** or **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)**. In this implementation, DFS is used to traverse each connected component, marking visited nodes, and counting the number of connected components (provinces). The time complexity of this approach is **O(nÂ²)**, as we iterate over an `n x n` matrix.

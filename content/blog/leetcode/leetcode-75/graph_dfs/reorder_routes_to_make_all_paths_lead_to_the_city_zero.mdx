## Problem Statement


There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network forms a tree). Last year, the ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

Roads are represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a road from city `ai` to city `bi`.

This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city `0`), and many people want to travel to this city.

Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit city `0`. Return the **minimum** number of edges changed.

It is **guaranteed** that each city can reach city `0` after reorder.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:

- `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `connections.length == n - 1`
- `connections[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1`
- `ai != bi`

### Implementation in Go

```go
func minReorder(n int, connections [][]int) int {
    roads := make(map[int][][]int)
    for _, conn := range connections {
        a, b := conn[0], conn[1]
        roads[a] = append(roads[a], []int{b, 1}) // directed edge
        roads[b] = append(roads[b], []int{a, 0}) // reverse direction
    }
    
    visited := make([]bool, n)
    var dfs func(int) int
    dfs = func(city int) int {
        visited[city] = true
        count := 0
        for _, next := range roads[city] {
            if !visited[next[0]] {
                count += next[1] + dfs(next[0])
            }
        }
        return count
    }
    
    return dfs(0)
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minReorder(int n, int[][] connections) {
        List<int[]>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int[] conn : connections) {
            graph[conn[0]].add(new int[]{conn[1], 1});
            graph[conn[1]].add(new int[]{conn[0], 0}); 
        }
        
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        return dfs(graph, visited, 0);
    }
    
    private int dfs(List<int[]>[] graph, boolean[] visited, int city) {
        visited[city] = true;
        int count = 0;
        for (int[] next : graph[city]) {
            if (!visited[next[0]]) {
                count += next[1] + dfs(graph, visited, next[0]);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minReorder(self, n: int, connections: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        
        for conn in connections:
            graph[conn[0]].append((conn[1], 1))  
            graph[conn[1]].append((conn[0], 0)) 
        
        visited = [False] * n
        
        def dfs(city: int) -> int:
            visited[city] = True
            count = 0
            for next_city, reorder_needed in graph[city]:
                if not visited[next_city]:
                    count += reorder_needed + dfs(next_city)
            return count
        
        return dfs(0)
```


## Conclusion

This problem can be efficiently solved using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** on a **graph representation** of cities and roads. We traverse from city `0`, keeping track of necessary changes and marking visited cities. The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, as we visit each city once.

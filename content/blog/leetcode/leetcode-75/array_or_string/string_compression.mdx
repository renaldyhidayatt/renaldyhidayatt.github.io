## Problem Statement
Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

1. Begin with an empty string `s`.
2. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
   - If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
   - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

The compressed string should be stored in the input character array `chars`. The function should return the new length of `chars` after compression. The algorithm must use only constant extra space.

### Example 1:
**Input:** `chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]`

**Output:** `6`, and the first 6 characters of `chars` should be `["a","2","b","2","c","3"]`

### Example 2:
**Input:** `chars = ["a"]`

**Output:** `1`, and the first character of `chars` should be `["a"]`

### Example 3:
**Input:** `chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]`

**Output:** `4`, and the first 4 characters of `chars` should be `["a","b","1","2"]`

## Approach
We iterate over the `chars` array, keeping track of consecutive repeated characters. When a different character appears, we append the character and its count (if greater than 1) to the array. The process ensures an in-place modification with O(1) extra space.

## Algorithm
1. Initialize a pointer `write` to track the position in `chars`.
2. Iterate through `chars` using `read`.
3. Count consecutive occurrences of each character.
4. Write the character to `chars`.
5. If count > 1, write the count as characters.
6. Return the new length.

## Implementation

### Implementation in Go
```go
func compress(chars []byte) int {
    write, read := 0, 0
    for read < len(chars) {
        char := chars[read]
        count := 0
        
        for read < len(chars) && chars[read] == char {
            read++
            count++
        }
        
        chars[write] = char
        write++
        
        if count > 1 {
            for _, c := range []byte(fmt.Sprintf("%d", count)) {
                chars[write] = c
                write++
            }
        }
    }
    return write
}
```

### Implementation in Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int write = 0, read = 0;
        
        while (read < chars.length) {
            char currentChar = chars[read];
            int count = 0;
            
            while (read < chars.length && chars[read] == currentChar) {
                read++;
                count++;
            }
            
            chars[write++] = currentChar;
            
            if (count > 1) {
                for (char c : String.valueOf(count).toCharArray()) {
                    chars[write++] = c;
                }
            }
        }
        return write;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        write = read = 0
        while read < len(chars):
            char = chars[read]
            count = 0

            while read < len(chars) and chars[read] == char:
                read += 1
                count += 1

            chars[write] = char
            write += 1

          
            if count > 1:
                for c in str(count):
                    chars[write] = c
                    write += 1

        return write
```

## Explanation
- We iterate through `chars`, grouping consecutive occurrences.
- We write the character and its count (if greater than 1) back to `chars`.
- The function returns the new length of `chars`.

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), since we iterate over `chars` once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we modify `chars` in place.

## Conclusion
This algorithm efficiently compresses the character array in-place while maintaining O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity. The approach ensures minimal memory usage while following the problem constraints.

## 1. Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in **O(n)** time and **without using the division operation**.

### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
**Output:** `[24,12,8,6]`

### Example 2:
**Input:** `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`
**Output:** `[0,0,9,0,0]`

### Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The input is generated such that `answer[i]` is guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit integer**.

### Follow-up:
Can you solve the problem in **O(1)** extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## 2. Approach
We use two passes to calculate prefix and suffix products without division:
1. Compute the prefix product for each index.
2. Compute the suffix product and update the result.

## 3. Algorithm
1. Initialize an output array `answer` with `1`s.
2. Compute prefix products in the first loop.
3. Compute suffix products in the second loop while updating `answer`.

## 4. Implementations

### Implementation in Go
```go
func productExceptSelf(nums []int) []int {
    n := len(nums)
    answer := make([]int, n)
    
    // Compute prefix products
    answer[0] = 1
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        answer[i] = answer[i-1] * nums[i-1]
    }
    
    // Compute suffix products and update result
    suffix := 1
    for i := n - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
        answer[i] *= suffix
        suffix *= nums[i]
    }
    
    return answer
}
```

### Implementation in Java
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        
        // Compute prefix products
        answer[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            answer[i] = answer[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        
        // Compute suffix products and update result
        int suffix = 1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            answer[i] *= suffix;
            suffix *= nums[i];
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

## 6. Explanation
- The **prefix pass** builds an array where `answer[i]` contains the product of all elements before index `i`.
- The **suffix pass** multiplies `answer[i]` by the product of all elements after index `i`, giving the final result.

## 7. Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, as we traverse the array twice.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we only use the output array for storage.

## Conclusion
This approach effectively computes the result in `O(n)` tim

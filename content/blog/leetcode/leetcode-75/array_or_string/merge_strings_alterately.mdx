## 1. Problem Statement

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with `word1`. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```plaintext
word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
"apbqcr"
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```plaintext
word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
"apbqrs"
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

---

## 2. Approach

We will use two pointers to iterate over both strings and construct the merged string by alternating characters from each string. If one string is longer, we append the remaining characters at the end.

---

## 3. Algorithm

1. Initialize two pointers `i` and `j` for `word1` and `word2` respectively.
2. Iterate while either `i` or `j` is within bounds:
   - Append the character from `word1` if `i` is within bounds.
   - Append the character from `word2` if `j` is within bounds.
   - Increment the respective pointers.
3. Convert the list of characters to a string and return it.

## 4. Flowchart

```plaintext
Start
   |
   v
Initialize i, j = 0
   |
   v
Loop while i < len(word1) OR j < len(word2)
   |       |
   |       v
   |    Append word1[i] (if i < len(word1))
   |    Increment i
   |       |
   |       v
   |    Append word2[j] (if j < len(word2))
   |    Increment j
   |
   v
Convert list to string
   |
   v
Return merged string
```

## 5. Implementations

### **Implementation in Go**

```go
func mergeAlternately(word1 string, word2 string) string {
    var result []byte
    i, j := 0, 0
    n, m := len(word1), len(word2)

    for i < n || j < m {
        if i < n {
            result = append(result, word1[i])
            i++
        }
        if j < m {
            result = append(result, word2[j])
            j++
        }
    }
    return string(result)
}
```

### **Implementation in Java**

```java
class MergeStrings {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < word1.length() || j < word2.length()) {
            if (i < word1.length()) result.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            if (j < word2.length()) result.append(word2.charAt(j++));
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

## 6. Explanation

Each implementation uses two pointers to iterate over the strings and construct the merged string character by character. The approach ensures that characters are interleaved as required, and any remaining characters from the longer string are appended at the end.

---

## 7. Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)`, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`. Each character is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n + m)`, as we store the result in a new string.

---

## 8. Conclusion

This problem demonstrates an efficient way to merge two strings alternately using a simple iterative approach. The two-pointer technique ensures an optimal solution with linear time complexity. The implementations in different languages follow the same logic, making it easy to understand and adapt.

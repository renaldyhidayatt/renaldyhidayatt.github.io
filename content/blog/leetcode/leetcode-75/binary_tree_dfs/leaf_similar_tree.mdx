## Problem Statement


Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a **leaf value sequence**.

Two binary trees are considered **leaf-similar** if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

**Examples:**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root1 = [1,2,3], root2 = [1,3,2]
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in each tree will be in the range `[1, 200]`.
- Both of the given trees will have values in the range `[0, 200]`.

## Implementation in Go

```go
// Definition for a binary tree node.
type TreeNode struct {
    Val   int
    Left  *TreeNode
    Right *TreeNode
}

func getLeaves(root *TreeNode, leaves *[]int) {
    if root == nil {
        return
    }
    if root.Left == nil && root.Right == nil {
        *leaves = append(*leaves, root.Val)
    }
    getLeaves(root.Left, leaves)
    getLeaves(root.Right, leaves)
}

func leafSimilar(root1 *TreeNode, root2 *TreeNode) bool {
    var leaves1, leaves2 []int
    getLeaves(root1, &leaves1)
    getLeaves(root2, &leaves2)
    return reflect.DeepEqual(leaves1, leaves2)
}
```

## Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

class Solution {
    private void getLeaves(TreeNode root, List<Integer> leaves) {
        if (root == null) return;
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            leaves.add(root.val);
        }
        getLeaves(root.left, leaves);
        getLeaves(root.right, leaves);
    }
    
    public boolean leafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        List<Integer> leaves1 = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> leaves2 = new ArrayList<>();
        getLeaves(root1, leaves1);
        getLeaves(root2, leaves2);
        return leaves1.equals(leaves2);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

This approach efficiently computes the leaf sequences of two binary trees and compares them using list equality. The time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the larger tree, and the space complexity is `O(h)`, where `h` is the tree height due to the recursive call stack.

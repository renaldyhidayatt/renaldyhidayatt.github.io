## Problem Statement


You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`th day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

#### Notes:
- You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
- The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 10^4`
- `0 <= fee < 5 * 10^4`

## Approach

We can solve this problem using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

### Implementation in Go

```go
func maxProfit(prices []int, fee int) int {
    n := len(prices)
    if n == 0 {
        return 0
    }
    cash, hold := 0, -prices[0]
    for i := 1; i < n; i++ {
        cash = max(cash, hold+prices[i]-fee)
        hold = max(hold, cash-prices[i])
    }
    return cash
}

func max(a, b int) int {
    if a > b {
        return a
    }
    return b
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int cash = 0, hold = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            cash = Math.max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee);
            hold = Math.max(hold, cash - prices[i]);
        }
        return cash;
    }
}
```

### Implementation in Python

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: list[int], fee: int) -> int:
        cash, hold = 0, -prices[0]
        for price in prices[1:]:
            cash = max(cash, hold + price - fee)
            hold = max(hold, cash - price)
        return cash
```

## Explanation

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - `cash` represents the maximum profit when we donâ€™t own a stock.
   - `hold` represents the maximum profit when we own a stock.
2. **Transition Formula**:
   - `cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)` (sell stock)
   - `hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])` (buy stock)
3. **Final Result**:
   - The maximum profit is stored in `cash`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, since we iterate through the `prices` array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we only use two variables (`cash` and `hold`).

## Conclusion

Using **Dynamic Programming**, we efficiently compute the maximum profit that can be obtained while considering transaction fees.

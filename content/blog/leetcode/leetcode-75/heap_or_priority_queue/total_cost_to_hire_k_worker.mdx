## Problem Statement


You are given a 0-indexed integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the `i`-th worker.

You are also given two integers `k` and `candidates`. We want to hire exactly `k` workers according to the following rules:

- You will run `k` sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
- In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
- If there are fewer than `candidates` workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
- A worker can only be chosen once.

### Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4
Output: 11
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [1,2,4,1], k = 3, candidates = 3
Output: 4
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= costs.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= costs[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k, candidates <= costs.length`

### Implementation in Go

```go
import (
    "container/heap"
)

type MinHeap []int

func (h MinHeap) Len() int           { return len(h) }
func (h MinHeap) Less(i, j int) bool { return h[i] < h[j] }
func (h MinHeap) Swap(i, j int)      { h[i], h[j] = h[j], h[i] }
func (h *MinHeap) Push(x interface{}) { *h = append(*h, x.(int)) }
func (h *MinHeap) Pop() interface{} {
    old := *h
    n := len(old)
    x := old[n-1]
    *h = old[:n-1]
    return x
}

func totalCost(costs []int, k int, candidates int) int {
    minHeap := &MinHeap{}
    heap.Init(minHeap)
    totalCost := 0
    
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        heap.Push(minHeap, costs[i])
    }
    
    for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
        totalCost += heap.Pop(minHeap).(int)
    }
    return totalCost
}
```

### Implementation in Java

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int totalCost(int[] costs, int k, int candidates) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int totalCost = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            minHeap.offer(costs[i]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            totalCost += minHeap.poll();
        }

        return totalCost;
    }
}
```
### Implementation in Python

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def totalCost(self, costs, k, candidates):
        min_heap = []
        total_cost = 0

        for i in range(k):
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, costs[i])

        for _ in range(k):
            total_cost += heapq.heappop(min_heap)

        return total_cost

```


## Conclusion

This problem can be efficiently solved using a **Min Heap (Priority Queue)** to keep track of the `k` lowest costs. The time complexity is **O(n log k)** due to heap operations.

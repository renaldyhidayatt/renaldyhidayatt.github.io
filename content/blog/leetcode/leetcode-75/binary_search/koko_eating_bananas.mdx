## Problem Statement


Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `i-th` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer `k` such that she can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= piles.length <= 10^4`
- `piles.length <= h <= 10^9`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9`

## Approach

We can solve this problem efficiently using **Binary Search** on the eating speed `k`.

## Implementation in Go

```go
func minEatingSpeed(piles []int, h int) int {
    left, right := 1, getMax(piles)
    
    for left < right {
        mid := left + (right-left)/2
        if canEatAll(piles, h, mid) {
            right = mid
        } else {
            left = mid + 1
        }
    }
    
    return left
}

func getMax(piles []int) int {
    maxVal := piles[0]
    for _, v := range piles {
        if v > maxVal {
            maxVal = v
        }
    }
    return maxVal
}

func canEatAll(piles []int, h, k int) bool {
    hours := 0
    for _, bananas := range piles {
        hours += (bananas + k - 1) / k
    }
    return hours <= h
}
```

## Implementation in Java

```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        int left = 1, right = getMax(piles);
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canEatAll(piles, h, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    private int getMax(int[] piles) {
        int maxVal = piles[0];
        for (int num : piles) {
            maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, num);
        }
        return maxVal;
    }
    
    private boolean canEatAll(int[] piles, int h, int k) {
        int hours = 0;
        for (int bananas : piles) {
            hours += (bananas + k - 1) / k;
        }
        return hours <= h;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Binary Search**: Instead of checking all possible speeds, we use binary search between `1` and the maximum pile size.
2. **Check Feasibility**: We define a function `canEatAll(piles, h, k)` to check if Koko can eat all bananas within `h` hours.
3. **Update Search Space**: If she can eat in `h` hours, try a smaller `k`, else increase `k`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log m)`, where `n` is the number of piles and `m` is the max pile size.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we use a constant amount of extra space.

## Conclusion

Using **Binary Search**, we efficiently find the minimum speed `k` to eat all bananas within `h` hours. This approach significantly optimizes performance compared to brute-force methods.

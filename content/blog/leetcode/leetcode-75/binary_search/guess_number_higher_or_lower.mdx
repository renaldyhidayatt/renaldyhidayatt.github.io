## Problem Statement


We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

- `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
- `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
- `0`: Your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return the number that I picked.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
- `1 <= pick <= n`

## Approach

We can solve this problem using **Binary Search** because the feedback (higher/lower) helps us eliminate half of the search space at each step.

## Implementation in Go

```go
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return       -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *                1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *                otherwise return 0
 */
func guess(num int) int

func guessNumber(n int) int {
    left, right := 1, n
    for left <= right {
        mid := left + (right-left)/2
        res := guess(mid)
        if res == 0 {
            return mid
        } else if res == -1 {
            right = mid - 1
        } else {
            left = mid + 1
        }
    }
    return -1
}
```

## Implementation in Java

```java
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return       -1 if num is higher than the picked number
 *                1 if num is lower than the picked number
 *                otherwise return 0
 */
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int res = guess(mid);
            if (res == 0) {
                return mid;
            } else if (res == -1) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

- We use **Binary Search** to repeatedly halve the search space.
- If `guess(mid) == 0`, we return `mid` because it's the correct number.
- If `guess(mid) == -1`, we move `right` to `mid - 1`.
- If `guess(mid) == 1`, we move `left` to `mid + 1`.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)`, since Binary Search reduces the search space by half in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we use only a few integer variables.

## Conclusion

This problem is efficiently solved using **Binary Search**, making it an optimal solution in `O(log n)` time complexity.

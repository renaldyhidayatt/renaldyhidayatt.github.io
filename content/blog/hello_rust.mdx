# Hello World in Rust

Rust is a powerful and safe programming language suitable for various applications. Let's start with the traditional "Hello World" program to get a feel for how Rust works.

## Writing Your First Rust Program

To write a "Hello World" program in Rust, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Text Editor:** You can use any text editor or code editor of your choice. Create a new file and save it with a `.rs` extension, like `hello.rs`.

2. **Write the Code:** In your `.rs` file, enter the following code:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}
```

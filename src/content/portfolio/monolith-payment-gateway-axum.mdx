# Example Sea Query Tonic Payment Gateway

The **Digital Payment Platform** is a reliable, scalable, and secure integrated system designed to streamline various digital financial transactions. Built using a **monolithic Rust-based architecture**, all core functionalities—such as card management, transactions, fund transfers, and merchant operations—are consolidated into a single application. This simplifies development and deployment, while maintaining high performance and observability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🔧 **Axum** — Web framework for building high-performant RESTful APIs in Rust.
- 🚀 **Tonic** — A gRPC over HTTP/2 implementation for building fast, type-safe services in Rust.
- 🧰 **SQLx + SeaQuery** — Async SQL toolkit + query builder for working with PostgreSQL efficiently.
- 📈 **Prometheus** — Gathers real-time metrics for APIs and system components.
- 🛰️ **OpenTelemetry** — Enables distributed tracing and telemetry collection.
- 🧵 **Tracing** — Instrumentation framework for structured logging and observability.
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL** — Primary relational database for storing application and user data.
- 🐳 **Docker & Docker Compose** — Containerization tools for local development and deployment.
- 📥 **Loki** — Centralized log aggregation system for observability.
- 📤 **Promtail** — Collects logs and ships them to Loki.
- 🔧 **OTel Collector** — Bridges metrics, traces, and logs to your observability stack.
- 🖥️ **Node Exporter** — Collects system-level metrics (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.).
- 📊 **Grafana** — Dashboard tool for visualizing metrics and logs.
- 🔍 **Jaeger** — Distributed tracing backend.
- 🧪 **Postman** — API client for testing HTTP and gRPC endpoints.

## Project Description

The **Movie GRPC** project is a **CRUD** application for managing movies, built with **Golang and GORM**. The application uses **gRPC** for communication between services and is supported by observability tools including **Jaeger, OpenTelemetry (Otel), and Prometheus** for monitoring and tracing. All services run in a **Docker** environment for easy deployment.

### Key Features
- **Movie CRUD**: 🎬 Uses **GORM** 📦 as the ORM for database interaction.
- **gRPC Communication**: 🖧 The API is developed using **gRPC** for high efficiency and performance.
- **Observability**: 🐆 Implements **Jaeger** and 🌐 **OpenTelemetry (Otel)** for distributed tracing.
- **Monitoring**: 📊 Integrated with **Prometheus** for system metrics monitoring.
- **Containerized**: 🐋 All services are run within **Docker** for easier management and deployment.

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: 🦸‍♂️ **Golang**, 🚀 **Gin**, 🖧 **gRPC**
- **Database**: 📦 **GORM** (ORM for Golang)
- **Observability**: 🐆 **Jaeger**, 🌐 **OpenTelemetry (Otel)**
- **Monitoring**: 📊 **Prometheus**
- **Containerization**: 🐋 **Docker**

# Understanding Go Concurrency

Go (or Golang) was designed with concurrency in mind, making it one of the `go-to` languages for building efficient, scalable systems. Concurrency in Go is lightweight and easy to manage thanks to goroutines, channels, and other synchronization primitives. In this article, we will explore different concurrency patterns and techniques in Go, ranging from simple goroutines to more complex constructs like worker pools and handling race conditions.

### 1. Introduction to Goroutines

Goroutines are the building blocks of concurrency in Go. They are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime, making them highly efficient. Starting a goroutine is as simple as adding the `go` keyword before a function call. Goroutines run independently and concurrently with other goroutines.

#### Basic Goroutine Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    go doSomething() 
    go doSomethingElse()

    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) 
    fmt.Println("Main function is done")
}

func doSomething() {
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Task 1 completed")
}

func doSomethingElse() {
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Task 2 completed")
}
```
#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: This code demonstrates the use of goroutines for concurrent execution.
- **Goroutine**: A lightweight thread managed by Go’s runtime. We use go keyword to start new goroutines.
	- go doSomething() starts a new goroutine to execute the doSomething function concurrently.
	- go doSomethingElse() does the same for the doSomethingElse function.
- **Concurrency**: The two tasks (doSomething and doSomethingElse) run concurrently and are not blocked by the main function.
- **Sleep**: time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) ensures that the main function does not exit immediately, allowing the goroutines enough time to complete their tasks.


#### WithOut Concurrency

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/csv"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery"
)

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	
	urls := []string{
		"https://www.detik.com/",
		"https://www.tempo.co/",
		"https://www.thejakartapost.com/",
	}

	// Create a CSV file to store the results
	file, err := os.Create("news_titles_no_concurrency.csv")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Could not create CSV file: %v", err)
	}
	defer file.Close()

	// Create a CSV writer
	writer := csv.NewWriter(file)
	defer writer.Flush()

	// Write the header
	writer.Write([]string{"Website", "Title"})

	// Fetch titles from each URL one by one
	for _, url := range urls {
		fetchAndWriteTitle(url, writer)
	}

	elapsed := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Fetching titles without concurrency took %s\n", elapsed)
}

func fetchAndWriteTitle(url string, writer *csv.Writer) {
	resp, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Failed to fetch %s: %v", url, err)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		log.Printf("Error: Status code %d for %s", resp.StatusCode, url)
		return
	}

	// Parse the page using goquery
	doc, err := goquery.NewDocumentFromReader(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Error parsing %s: %v", url, err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("\nArticles from %s:\n", url)

	
	if url == "https://www.detik.com/" {
		doc.Find(".media__title a").Each(func(i int, s *goquery.Selection) {
			title := s.Text()
			fmt.Printf(" - %s\n", title)
			writer.Write([]string{url, title})
		})
	} else if url == "https://www.tempo.co/" {
		doc.Find(".title").Each(func(i int, s *goquery.Selection) {
			title := s.Text()
			fmt.Printf(" - %s\n", title)
			writer.Write([]string{url, title})
		})
	} else if url == "https://www.thejakartapost.com/" {
		doc.Find(".title a").Each(func(i int, s *goquery.Selection) {
			title := s.Text()
			fmt.Printf(" - %s\n", title)
			writer.Write([]string{url, title})
		})
	}
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: This example fetches article titles from different websites and stores them in a CSV file without concurrency.
- **How it works**:
	- **fetchAndWriteTitle**: Fetches the page from each URL, parses it, extracts the titles, and writes them to a CSV file.
	- The for loop processes each URL sequentially (one after the other).
- **Time Tracking**: time.Now() and time.Since(start) are used to measure how long the whole process takes without concurrency.
- **No Concurrency**: Since the program processes URLs one by one, it will take longer compared to a concurrent approach, especially when working with slow networks or many URLs.


#### Goroutine Example with WaitGroup

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"sync"
	"time"

	"github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery"
)

var wg sync.WaitGroup

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	
	urls := []string{
		"https://www.detik.com/",
		"https://www.tempo.co/",
		"https://www.thejakartapost.com/",
	}

	wg.Add(len(urls))

	for _, url := range urls {
		go fetchTitle(url)
	}

	wg.Wait()

	elapsed := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Fetching titles took %s\n", elapsed)
}

func fetchTitle(url string) {
	defer wg.Done()

	resp, err := http.Get(url)
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Failed to fetch %s: %v", url, err)
		return
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	if resp.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {
		log.Printf("Error: Status code %d for %s", resp.StatusCode, url)
		return
	}

	// Parse the page using goquery
	doc, err := goquery.NewDocumentFromReader(resp.Body)
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("Error parsing %s: %v", url, err)
		return
	}

	fmt.Printf("\nArticles from %s:\n", url)

	// Different websites have different HTML structures, so we need to extract titles accordingly
	if url == "https://www.detik.com/" {
		doc.Find(".media__title a").Each(func(i int, s *goquery.Selection) {
			title := s.Text()
			fmt.Printf(" - %s\n", title)
		})
	} else if url == "https://www.tempo.co/" {
		doc.Find(".title").Each(func(i int, s *goquery.Selection) {
			title := s.Text()
			fmt.Printf(" - %s\n", title)
		})
	} else if url == "https://www.thejakartapost.com/" {
		doc.Find(".title a").Each(func(i int, s *goquery.Selection) {
			title := s.Text()
			fmt.Printf(" - %s\n", title)
		})
	}
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: This version uses goroutines and sync.WaitGroup to process URLs concurrently.
- **Goroutines**: Each URL is fetched and processed in a separate goroutine. This allows the URLs to be processed in parallel, reducing the total execution time.
- **WaitGroup**: sync.WaitGroup is used to make sure the main function waits for all goroutines to finish before exiting.
	- ``wg.Add(len(urls))`` adds the number of URLs to the waitgroup counter.
	- `defer wg.Done()` is used in each goroutine to signal that the work is done.
	- `wg.Wait()` waits for all goroutines to complete before proceeding.
- **Concurrency**: This method fetches and processes multiple URLs in parallel, speeding up the process significantly compared to the sequential version.


### 2. Synchronization with WaitGroup
While the previous example uses time.Sleep to give the goroutines enough time to finish, this isn’t a robust approach. In `real-world` applications, we can use sync.WaitGroup to wait for multiple goroutines to complete their execution.

#### 1. Without Synchronization

```go
package nyoba2

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func GoroSleep() {
	start := time.Now()
	go doSomething()
	go doSomethingElse()

	time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)

	fmt.Println("\n\nI guess I'm done")
	elapsed := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Processes took %s", elapsed)
}

func doSomethingGoSleep() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("\nI've done something")
}

func doSomethingElseGoSleep() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("I've done something else")
}

```

#### Explanation:
- **Problem**: This code launches two goroutines (doSomething and doSomethingElse), and then the main function sleeps for 5 seconds using time.Sleep(). The sleep is used to give enough time for the goroutines to complete.
- **Issue**: While this approach works for simple cases, it isn't reliable for real-world applications because the required time for goroutines to finish can vary, and hardcoding a sleep duration is not ideal.
- **Outcome**: The program waits for a fixed amount of time (5 seconds), regardless of whether the goroutines have finished.


#### 2. No Synchronization

```go
package nyoba2

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func GoroutineDoang() {
	start := time.Now()
	go doSomething()
	go doSomethingElse()

	fmt.Println("\n\nI guess I'm done")
	elapsed := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Processes took %s", elapsed)
}

func doSomethingGo() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("\nI've done something")
}

func doSomethingElseGo() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("I've done something else")
}
```
#### Explanation:
- **Problem**: This version does not use any synchronization mechanism or sleep function. The two goroutines (doSomethingGo and doSomethingElseGo) are launched concurrently.
- **Outcome**: Since there is no synchronization, the fmt.Println("I guess I'm done") message in the main function may print before the goroutines complete. The main function finishes too early without waiting for the goroutines.
- **Issue**: The program terminates prematurely, which is common when there is no proper synchronization, leading to incomplete execution of the tasks.


#### 3. Without WaitGroup, Fixed Sleep

```go
func NotUsing() {
	start := time.Now()
	go doSomething()
	go doSomethingElse()

	time.Sleep(time.Second * 5)

	fmt.Println("\n\nI guess I'm done")
	elapsed := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Processes took %s", elapsed)
}

func doSomething() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("\nI've done something")
}

func doSomethingElse() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("I've done something else")
}
```
#### Explanation:
- **Same Problem**: As in the first example (GoroSleep), this approach uses a hardcoded sleep of 5 seconds to wait for goroutines to finish.
- **Outcome**: While this might work, it is not flexible and can lead to issues when the completion time of the goroutines is unpredictable. The program might wait too long or not long enough, depending on the tasks.

#### 4. WaitGroup Explanation

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

var wg sync.WaitGroup

func main() {
	start := time.Now()

	// Tell the WaitGroup to wait for 2 goroutines
	wg.Add(2)

	// Start the two goroutines
	go doSomething()
	go doSomethingElse()

	// Wait for the two goroutines to complete
	wg.Wait()

	// The main function will only proceed after both goroutines are done
	fmt.Println("\n\nI guess I'm done")
	elapsed := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Processes took %s", elapsed)
}

func doSomething() {
	defer wg.Done() // Notify that this goroutine is done

	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("\nI've done something")
}

func doSomethingElse() {
	defer wg.Done() // Notify that this goroutine is done

	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("I've done something else")
}
```
#### Explanation:
- **WaitGroup**: sync.WaitGroup is a synchronization primitive that allows you to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.
	- `wg.Add(2)`: Increases the counter by 2, indicating that we are expecting two goroutines to complete.
	- `wg.Done()`: Each goroutine must call wg.Done() when it finishes, decrementing the counter.
	- `wg.Wait()`: This blocks the main function from exiting until the counter reaches 0, i.e., when both goroutines finish.
- **Concurrency Handling**: This approach ensures that the main function waits for both doSomething and doSomethingElse goroutines to complete before printing "I guess I'm done."


### 3. Channels for Communication
Channels are another key feature in Go’s concurrency model. They are used for communication between goroutines, ensuring safe data exchange without the need for complex locking mechanisms. Channels can either block the sender or receiver until the other side is ready.

Basic Channel Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    ch := make(chan string)

    go sendMessage(ch)

    message := <-ch // Wait for the message
    fmt.Println("Received:", message)
}

func sendMessage(ch chan<- string) {
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    ch <- "Hello from the goroutine!" // Send a message through the channel
}
```

Here, the main function waits until it receives a message from the sendMessage goroutine via the channel `ch`.

### 4. Buffered Channels
Buffered channels allow you to send multiple values before blocking the sender. They are useful when you need to process multiple tasks concurrently without the overhead of waiting for every individual message to be processed immediately.

Buffered Channel Example:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    ch := make(chan string, 2)

    go sendBufferedMessage(ch)
    time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)

    for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
        fmt.Println(<-ch) // Receive both messages from the channel
    }
}

func sendBufferedMessage(ch chan<- string) {
    ch <- "Message 1"
    ch <- "Message 2"
    time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
    fmt.Println("Messages sent")
}
```


In this example, the buffered channel can hold two messages without blocking the sender, making the communication between goroutines more efficient.

### 5. Worker Pool
A worker pool pattern is useful when you have a large number of jobs to process and want to distribute the workload across a fixed number of worker goroutines. This approach helps manage resource usage and parallelizes the work efficiently.

#### 1. Buffered Channel Example

```go
func BuffredChannel() {
	c := make(chan string, 3)
	c <- "Hello "
	c <- "Earth "
	c <- "from Mars"

	msg := <-c
	fmt.Print(msg)

	msg = <-c
	fmt.Print(msg)

	msg = <-c
	fmt.Print(msg)
}
```

#### Explanation:
- Buffered Channels allow sending data to the channel without needing an immediate receiver, up to its capacity. In this example, the channel c can hold 3 values.
- The values "Hello ", "Earth ", and "from Mars" are sent into the channel. They are then received and printed in the order they were sent.
- This demonstrates how buffered channels help in decoupling the sender and receiver, allowing them to work independently to some extent.


#### 2. Basic Channel Usage with Goroutines

```go
package nyoba5

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

var ch = make(chan string)

func Channel1() {
	start := time.Now()
	go doSomething()
	go doSomethingElse()

	fmt.Println(<-ch)
	fmt.Println(<-ch)

	fmt.Println("I guess I'm done")
	elapsed := time.Since(start)
	fmt.Printf("Processes took %s", elapsed)
}

func doSomething() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("\nI've done something")
	ch <- "doSomething finished"
}

func doSomethingElse() {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 2)
	fmt.Println("I've done something else")
	ch <- "doSomethingElse finished"
}
```

#### Explanation:
- Channels are used to communicate between goroutines. Here, two goroutines (doSomething and doSomethingElse) perform tasks and send messages to the shared channel ch.
- The main goroutine waits for messages using `<-ch `before proceeding, ensuring both tasks are complete before printing the final message.
- Time.sleep(2 seconds) simulates work in both goroutines, and messages are printed only after the goroutines send their results.


#### 3. Synchronization with Channels

```go
package nyoba5

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

var result = 0
var value = 97

func ChannelSync() {
	goChan := make(chan int)
	mainChan := make(chan string)
	go calculateSquare(value, goChan)
	go reportResult(goChan, mainChan)
}

func calculateSquare(value int, goChan chan int) {
	fmt.Println("Calculating for 3 seconds...")
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
	result = value * value
	goChan <- result

}
func reportResult(goChan chan int, mainChan chan string) {
	time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
	fmt.Println("The result of", value, "squared", "is", <-goChan)
	// blocks until it can read something from goChan - printed
	mainChan <- "You can quit now.  I'm done."
}
```

#### Explanation:
- Two goroutines work in tandem. One calculates the square of value and sends it through goChan, while the other reads this result and reports it.
- calculateSquare does the computation after a 3-second delay, and reportResult waits for 1 second before reporting the result.
- Channels allow safe communication between the goroutines and ensure they work sequentially without the need for locks or complex synchronization.



#### 4. Channel with WaitGroup

```go
package nyoba5

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func Channel2() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	wg.Add(1)

	go func() {
		var value = 97
		var result = 0

		goChan := make(chan int)
		mainChan := make(chan string)
		calculateSquare := func() {
			time.Sleep(time.Second * 3)
			result = value * value
			goChan <- result
		}

		reportResult := func() {
			fmt.Println(value, "squared is", <-goChan)
			// blocks until it can read something from goChan - printed
			mainChan <- "You can quit now.  I'm done."
		}
		go calculateSquare()
		go reportResult()
		<-mainChan
		wg.Done()
	}()
	wg.Done()
}
```

#### Explanation:
- WaitGroup is used to wait for a set of goroutines to finish. The wg.Add(1) increments the -WaitGroup counter, and wg.Done() decrements it when the goroutine completes.
- This ensures the main function waits until the goroutine finishes before exiting.


#### 5. Large Workload with Channels and WaitGroup

```go
func Channel4() {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 1; i <= 10000; i++ {
		wg.Add(1)

		go func(j int) {
			var result = 0
			goChan := make(chan int)
			mainChan := make(chan string)
			calculateSquare := func() {
				time.Sleep(time.Second * 3) // Deliberate time delay
				result = j * j
				goChan <- result
			}
			reportResult := func() {
				fmt.Println(j, "squared is", <-goChan)
				mainChan <- "You can quit now.  I'm done."
			}

			go calculateSquare()
			go reportResult()
			<-mainChan
			wg.Done()
		}(i)
	}
	wg.Wait()
}
```
#### Explanation:
- This code launches 10,000 concurrent goroutines, each calculating the square of a number.
- A WaitGroup ensures the main program doesn’t terminate before all 10,000 goroutines finish.
Channels are used to synchronize results between the worker and the main thread.


#### 6. Multiple Channels Example

```go
package nyoba5

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"time"
)

func MultipleChannel() {
	c1 := make(chan string)
	c2 := make(chan string)
	c3 := make(chan string)

	go func() {
		for {
			time.Sleep(time.Second)
			c1 <- "Sending every 1 second"

		}
	}()
	go func() {
		for {
			time.Sleep(time.Second * 4)
			c2 <- "Sending every 4 sec"

		}
	}()
	go func() {
		for {
			time.Sleep(time.Second * 10)
			c3 <- "We're done"
		}
	}()

	for {
		select {
		case msg := <-c1:
			fmt.Println(msg)
		case msg := <-c2:
			fmt.Println(msg + " Something cool happened")
		case msg := <-c3:
			fmt.Println(msg)
			os.Exit(0)

		}
	}
}
```

#### Explanation:
- Multiple channels are used to simulate periodic events. Each goroutine sends messages to the main loop at different intervals (1, 4, and 10 seconds).
- The select statement allows handling messages from different channels in a non-blocking manner.
- The program exits when a message is received from c3.


#### 7. Worker Pool Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

func main() {
    const numJobs = 5
    jobs := make(chan int, numJobs)
    results := make(chan int, numJobs)

    // Start 3 workers
    for w := 1; w <= 3; w++ {
        go worker(w, jobs, results)
    }

    // Send jobs to the workers
    for j := 1; j <= numJobs; j++ {
        jobs <- j
    }
    close(jobs)

    // Collect results
    for a := 1; a <= numJobs; a++ {
        fmt.Println("Result:", <-results)
    }
}

func worker(id int, jobs <-chan int, results chan<- int) {
    for j := range jobs {
        fmt.Printf("Worker %d processing job %d\n", id, j)
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        results <- j
    }
}
```

#### Explanation:
- This code implements a Worker Pool where three worker goroutines process jobs from a shared jobs channel.
- Each worker sleeps for 2 seconds to simulate processing a job, then sends the job number back to the results channel.
- The main function sends 5 jobs and collects their results.
Worker pools are useful to control the number of concurrent goroutines and efficiently handle workloads.

### 6. Avoiding Race Conditions
Race conditions occur when two or more goroutines access shared data simultaneously, and the result of the program depends on the timing of their access. Go provides synchronization tools like sync.Mutex and atomic operations to prevent race conditions.


### 1. Race Condition Without Protection

```go
var (
	wg sync.WaitGroup

	widgetInventory int32 = 1000 //Package-level variable will avoid all the pointers
)

func RaceCondition1() {
	fmt.Println("Starting inventory count = ", widgetInventory)
	wg.Add(2)
	go makeSales()
	go newPurchases()
	wg.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Ending inventory count = ", widgetInventory)
}

func makeSales() { // 1000000 widgets sold
	for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {

		widgetInventory -= 100

	}
	wg.Done()
}

func newPurchases() { // 1000000 widgets purchased
	for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {

		widgetInventory += 100

	}
	wg.Done()
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Race Condition**: This code suffers from a race condition because both makeSales and newPurchases modify the widgetInventory variable simultaneously without synchronization. This leads to unpredictable results, as multiple goroutines access and modify the variable at the same time.
- **Fix Needed**: To fix this, we need to synchronize access to widgetInventory to ensure only one goroutine modifies it at a time.


```go
package nyoba7

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var (
	wg2              sync.WaitGroup
	mutex2                 = sync.Mutex{}
	widgetInventory2 int32 = 1000
)

func RaceCondition2() {
	fmt.Println("Starting inventory count = ", widgetInventory)
	wg2.Add(2)
	go makeSales2()
	go newPurchases2()
	wg2.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Ending inventory count = ", widgetInventory)
}

func makeSales2() {
	for i := 0; i < 300000; i++ {
		mutex2.Lock()
		widgetInventory2 -= 100
		mutex2.Unlock()
	}

	wg2.Done()
}

func newPurchases2() {
	for i := 0; i < 300000; i++ {
		mutex2.Lock()
		widgetInventory += 100
		mutex2.Unlock()
	}
	wg2.Done()
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Mutex Usage**: A sync.Mutex is introduced to lock access to widgetInventory2 when either makeSales2 or newPurchases2 modifies it.
- **Purpose**: This prevents simultaneous modification of the shared variable by ensuring that only one goroutine can execute the critical section (code where the variable is modified) at a time.
- **Effect**: This solves the race condition issue and ensures the final inventory count is correct.


```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"sync/atomic"
)

var (
	wg3 sync.WaitGroup

	widgetInventory3 int32 = 1000 //Package-level variable will avoid all the pointers
)

func RaceCondition3() {
	fmt.Println("Starting inventory count = ", widgetInventory)
	wg3.Add(2)
	go makeSales3()
	go newPurchases3()
	wg3.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Ending inventory count = ", widgetInventory)
}

func makeSales3() {
	for i := 0; i < 300000; i++ {

		atomic.AddInt32(&widgetInventory3, -100)

	}

	wg3.Done()
}

func newPurchases3() {
	for i := 0; i < 300000; i++ {

		atomic.AddInt32(&widgetInventory3, 100)

	}
	wg3.Done()
}

#### Explanation:
- **Atomic Operations**: This version uses atomic operations provided by the sync/atomic package. atomic.AddInt32 atomically increments or decrements the widgetInventory3 variable.
- **No Mutex Needed**: Since atomic operations ensure that modifications to shared variables are done safely without interruption, there is no need for a Mutex.
- **Purpose**: Atomic operations are efficient and can be faster than using a mutex because they avoid the overhead of locking.


```go
package nyoba7

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var (
	wg4              sync.WaitGroup
	mutex4                 = sync.Mutex{}
	widgetInventory4 int32 = 1000
)

func RaceCondition4() {
	fmt.Println("Starting inventory count = ", widgetInventory4)
	wg4.Add(2)
	go makeSales4()
	go newPurchases4()
	wg4.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Ending inventory count = ", widgetInventory4)
}

func makeSales4() {
	for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {
		mutex4.Lock()
		widgetInventory4 -= 100
		fmt.Println(widgetInventory4)
		mutex4.Unlock()
	}

	wg4.Done()
}

func newPurchases4() {
	for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {
		mutex4.Lock()
		widgetInventory4 += 100
		fmt.Println(widgetInventory4)
		mutex4.Unlock()
	}
	wg4.Done()
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Mutex with Output**: This version introduces print statements inside the critical section to display the current state of the widgetInventory4 variable after each update.
- **Purpose**: The debugging output helps track the inventory count as it is updated in real-time, and the Mutex ensures thread-safe access to the shared variable.


```go

package nyoba7

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var (
	wg5              sync.WaitGroup
	mutex5                 = sync.Mutex{}
	widgetInventory5 int32 = 1000
	newPurchase            = sync.NewCond(&mutex5)
)

func RaceCondition5() {
	fmt.Println("Starting inventory count = ", widgetInventory5)
	wg5.Add(2)
	go makeSales5()
	go newPurchases5()
	wg5.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Ending inventory count = ", widgetInventory5)
}

func makeSales5() { // 1000000 widgets sold
	for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {
		mutex5.Lock()
		if widgetInventory5-100 < 0 {
			newPurchase.Wait()
		}
		widgetInventory5 -= 100
		fmt.Println(widgetInventory5)
		mutex5.Unlock()
	}

	wg5.Done()
}

func newPurchases5() { // 1000000 widgets purchased
	for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {
		mutex5.Lock()
		widgetInventory5 += 100
		fmt.Println(widgetInventory5)
		newPurchase.Signal()
		mutex5.Unlock()
	}
	wg5.Done()
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Condition Variable**: A sync.Cond condition variable is used to handle scenarios where a sale cannot be made because the inventory would go negative.
- **Purpose**: If widgetInventory5 is too low, the sales goroutine waits until a new purchase is made. Once newPurchases5 adds inventory, it signals the waiting sales goroutine to continue.
- **Effect**: This prevents negative inventory while allowing the sales and purchase operations to continue concurrently.

```go
package nyoba7

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

var (
	wg6              sync.WaitGroup
	widgetInventory6 int32 = 1000
	c                      = make(chan int32, 6000)
)

func RaceCondition6() {
	fmt.Println("Starting inventory count = ", widgetInventory6)
	wg6.Add(2)
	go makeSales6(c)
	go newPurchases6(c)
	wg6.Wait()
	for len(c) > 0 {
		widgetInventory6 += <-c

	}
	fmt.Println("Ending inventory count = ", widgetInventory6)
}

func makeSales6(c chan int32) { // 300000 widgets sold
	for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {
		c <- -100
	}

	wg6.Done()
}

func newPurchases6(c chan int32) {
	for i := 0; i < 3000; i++ {
		c <- 100 // Put +100 purchase transaction into the channel
	}
	wg6.Done()
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Channels for Synchronization**: This version uses a channel c to handle the inventory updates, avoiding the use of locks or atomic operations.
- **Purpose**: Each sales or purchase goroutine sends its transaction (-100 or +100) to the channel. After both goroutines finish, the remaining transactions in the channel are processed to update the inventory.
- **Effect**: Channels ensure that the updates are applied sequentially and safely without the need for explicit locks or condition variables.



## Conclusion
Go’s concurrency model, built around goroutines and channels, provides a powerful and efficient way to handle multiple tasks at once. Whether you're using goroutines for simple concurrency, channels for communication, or more advanced patterns like worker pools, Go offers the tools you need to manage concurrency effectively. By combining these patterns and understanding synchronization techniques, you can write robust, scalable applications that make the most of modern hardware.

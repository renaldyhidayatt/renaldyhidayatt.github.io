## Case Study: Payment Gateway

In this case study, we focus on designing a robust database system for a payment gateway platform. This system handles key operations such as user registration, balance management, fund transfers, and transaction history, ensuring both performance and data integrity.

### Problem Definition
The primary objective of a payment gateway is to facilitate seamless and secure monetary transactions between users. This involves several critical operations that need to be optimized for speed and reliability:

- **User Management**: Ensuring secure and fast registration, authentication, and user data management.
- **Fund Operations**: Handling top-ups, withdrawals, and fund transfers accurately and securely.
- **Transaction Tracking**: Maintaining a reliable log of all transactions for auditing and user reference.

#### **Key Challenges**
- **Data Integrity**: Handling high volumes of transactions while ensuring that no data is lost or corrupted during the processes.
- **Concurrency**: Managing simultaneous operations (like top-ups, transfers, and withdrawals) without causing conflicts or race conditions.
- **Scalability**: Designing a system that can scale efficiently as the number of users and transactions grows.


#### **Database Design**
The database schema is designed to address the above challenges. Each key table corresponds to an essential part of the payment gateway’s functionality:

1. Users Table: This table stores personal details and credentials, supporting unique identification of each user.

    - **Unique Constraints**: Email and account number (noc_transfer) are set as unique fields to prevent duplication.
    - **Security Consideration**: Passwords should ideally be hashed before storage, though for simplicity, this example assumes raw storage.

2. **Topups Table**: This records all top-up transactions made by users, tracking the method and amount of the top-up.

    - **Referential Integrity**: user_id is a foreign key linked to the users table, ensuring each top-up is tied to a valid user.

3. **Saldo Table**: This table manages user balances, supporting both deposits and withdrawals. The total_balance field tracks the current available funds for each user.

    - **Concurrency Handling**: Care must be taken to prevent race conditions when updating balances, as multiple concurrent transactions (like transfers or withdrawals) could lead to inconsistent data.

4. **Transfers Table**: It tracks fund transfers between users. Each transaction is recorded with a timestamp and includes details of the sender and recipient.

    - **Data Integrity**: Each transfer is linked to both the sender and recipient through foreign keys, ensuring accountability for both parties.

5. **Withdraws Table**: This tracks withdrawal requests and records the amount and time of each transaction.

### SQL Schema and Case Study

);
```

### Focus Areas of the Case Study (Database-Focused)
In this case study of designing a robust database for a payment gateway system, we will focus on the essential database design considerations to ensure performance, data integrity, and scalability.

#### 1. Concurrency Management
- **Objective**: Prevent race conditions during concurrent operations (e.g., simultaneous top-ups, transfers, and withdrawals).
- **Solution**: Use database transactions to ensure atomic operations. A transaction ensures that all related updates, such as debiting one account and crediting another during a fund transfer, happen together. This avoids partial updates that could lead to data inconsistencies.
- **Implementation**:
    - Use 'BEGIN TRANSACTION', 'COMMIT', and 'ROLLBACK' to group operations and ensure atomicity.
    Leverage isolation levels to balance concurrency control and performance. The most commonly used levels are:
    - **Read Committed**: Allows concurrent access but prevents dirty reads.
    - **Serializable**: Ensures complete isolation but can lead to lower concurrency.

#### 2. Data Integrity
- **Objective**: Ensure the consistency and accuracy of the data stored in the database.
- **Solution**: Utilize constraints and referential integrity.
    - **Primary Keys**: Ensure each record in critical tables (like users, topups, transfers) has a unique identifier.
    - **Foreign Keys**: Enforce relationships between tables (e.g., transfers.user_id links to users.id) to ensure that each transaction is associated with a valid user.
    - **Unique Constraints**: Ensure fields like email or account_number are unique across the platform to prevent duplicate users or conflicting records.
    - **Check Constraints**: Apply business logic at the database level, such as ensuring a withdrawal_amount doesn’t exceed a user’s balance.

#### 3. Scalability
- **Objective**: Ensure the database can handle growth in both users and transaction volume without performance degradation.
- **Solution**: Implement strategies to optimize query performance and data storage.
    - **Indexing**: Index frequently queried fields like user_id, transfer_time, and balance to speed up search queries and prevent full table scans. Consider compound indexes for queries involving multiple columns.
    - **Sharding and Partitioning**: Split large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can be done by partitioning tables based on a timestamp (e.g., transfer_time) to spread out the data across multiple disks or servers.
    - **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently. This helps prevent database overload during peak usage times.

#### 4. Optimizing Transactions
- **Objective**: Maximize performance while ensuring that essential data operations remain consistent and secure.
- **Solution**:
    - **Batch Processing**: When possible, handle multiple database operations in a single batch to reduce overhead and improve throughput. For example, processing multiple transactions in bulk rather than one by one.
    - **Database Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., user balances) in memory to reduce load on the database and improve response times.
    - **Read-Write Separation**: For large-scale systems, consider separating reads and writes by using master-slave database configurations. This improves performance by distributing the read load across multiple replicas.

#### 5. Audit Logging
- **Objective**: Ensure that all transactions and key operations (such as user registration or fund transfers) are logged for future auditing and troubleshooting.
- **Solution**:
    - Implement a logging table or use triggers to automatically log critical database changes. This log can include:
        - Transaction details (e.g., transaction_id, amount, timestamp).
        - Changes to sensitive fields (e.g., updates to balance or user_status).
        - User actions (e.g., logins, failed login attempts, and transfers).
    - Logs should be immutable and append-only, ensuring that no past records can be modified.

### Case Study: Saldo Management in Payment Gateway
This case study focuses on the management of user balances ("saldo") in a payment gateway system. The saldo represents the total balance a user holds in the system, and it is critical to ensure that all operations, such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, are accurately reflected in the balance.

### Problem Definition
The challenge in saldo management is ensuring that the balance remains consistent during different types of transactions. Operations like withdrawals and transfers require precise updates to prevent issues like negative balances, race conditions, and data inconsistency.

### Key Challenges
1. **Consistency**: Ensuring the user balance (total_balance) remains accurate after each transaction.
2. **Concurrency**: Safeguarding against multiple users or processes modifying the same saldo at the same time.
3. **Scalability**: Efficiently managing a large number of balance operations for many users without performance degradation.


### Functions for Managing Saldo
To handle different saldo-related operations, several SQL queries are designed. Let's break down the key queries and their use cases:

### 1. CreateSaldo

```sql
-- name: CreateSaldo :one
INSERT INTO saldo (user_id, total_balance, withdraw_amount, withdraw_time)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
RETURNING *;
```

This query inserts a new saldo record for a user. This is typically used when a user first registers and their initial balance is set (e.g., during a first deposit or registration bonus).

- **Example Use Case**: A new user signs up, and the system creates their saldo record with an initial balance of 0.

### 2. GetAllSaldo

```sql
-- name: GetAllSaldo :many
SELECT * FROM saldo;
```

This query retrieves all saldo records in the database. It's useful for administrative purposes, where an overview of all user balances is required.

- **Example Use Case**: An admin wants to see a report of all users’ balances for auditing or reporting purposes.


### 3. GetSaldoById

```sql
-- name: GetSaldoById :one
SELECT * FROM saldo WHERE saldo_id = $1 LIMIT 1;
```

This query fetches a specific saldo by its unique saldo_id. It helps when you need detailed information about a particular saldo record.

- **Example Use Case**: A user reports an issue with their balance, and the support team needs to check the specific saldo record using its ID.


### 4. GetSaldoByUserId

```sql
-- name: GetSaldoByUserId :one
SELECT * FROM saldo WHERE user_id = $1 LIMIT 1;
```

This query retrieves the saldo record for a specific user by their user_id. Since each user has one saldo, this query will return their current balance.

- **Example Use Case**: When a user logs in and wants to view their balance, this query is used to retrieve their saldo based on their user ID.


### 5. UpdateSaldoBalance

```sql
-- name: UpdateSaldoBalance :one
UPDATE saldo SET total_balance = $1 WHERE user_id = $2 RETURNING *;
```

This query updates the total balance for a user. It's essential during top-ups or fund transfers when the balance changes.

- **Example Use Case**: A user tops up their account, and the system updates their total balance to reflect the new funds added.

### 6. GetSaldoByUsers

```sql
-- name: GetSaldoByUsers :many
SELECT * FROM saldo WHERE user_id = $1;
```

This query returns the saldo record for a specific user. Although similar to GetSaldoByUserId, it’s designed to handle cases where there might be multiple saldo records, although typically each user should have only one saldo.

- **Example Use Case**: Used when retrieving a saldo by user ID for various actions such as displaying a user’s balance or performing saldo updates.

### 7. UpdateSaldo

```sql
-- name: UpdateSaldo :one
UPDATE saldo SET total_balance = $1, withdraw_amount = $2, withdraw_time = $3 WHERE user_id = $4 RETURNING *;
```

This query updates both the total balance and the withdrawal information for a user. It's used when a user withdraws funds, requiring both the balance and withdrawal history to be updated simultaneously.

- **Example Use Case**: A user withdraws funds, and the system needs to update their balance and store the amount withdrawn and the time it occurred.

### 8. DeleteSaldo

```sql
-- name: DeleteSaldo :exec
DELETE FROM saldo WHERE user_id = $1 RETURNING *;
```

This query deletes a saldo record for a specific user. It's generally used for account deletion or cleanup tasks.

- **Example Use Case**: A user decides to close their account, and their saldo record is removed from the system.

### Case Study Walkthrough: Balance Update Process
One of the most critical operations in a payment gateway system is updating the user's balance accurately when they perform a transaction. For example, when a user initiates a transfer or withdraws funds, multiple steps must be coordinated to ensure the balance remains accurate. 

### Example Scenario: User Withdrawal
1. **Step 1: Retrieve User's Current Balance** Before any withdrawal operation is performed, the system first retrieves the current balance using the GetSaldoByUserId query.

```sql
SELECT * FROM saldo WHERE user_id = $1 LIMIT 1;
```

2. **Step 2**: Perform Withdrawal If the user has enough funds, the system processes the withdrawal and updates the saldo using the UpdateSaldo query. This updates both the total balance and withdrawal amount.

```sql
UPDATE saldo
SET total_balance = $1, withdraw_amount = $2, withdraw_time = $3
WHERE user_id = $4
RETURNING *;
```

- $1: The new total balance after withdrawal.
- $2: The amount withdrawn.
- $3: The time of the withdrawal.
- $4: The user_id of the person making the withdrawal.

3. **Step 3: Return Updated Balance** After successfully updating the saldo, the system returns the updated saldo record to confirm the new balance and withdrawal information.

## Case Study: Top-Up Management in Payment Gateway
This case study focuses on managing the top-up functionality in a payment gateway system. Top-ups are the process where users add funds to their accounts using various payment methods. Managing this efficiently is essential for ensuring that user balances are updated correctly and that the system remains secure and robust.

###  Problem Definition
The main challenge with top-ups is ensuring that they are processed quickly and reliably, and that the associated balance updates are reflected in real-time for users. Each top-up must be recorded accurately, as it directly impacts the user's available saldo (balance).

### Key Challenges
1. **Data Integrity**: Ensuring the top-up transaction data is stored correctly and associated with the correct user.
2. **Real-time Updates**: Reflecting top-up amounts in users' balances immediately to ensure funds are available for future transactions.
3. **Method Handling**: Supporting multiple top-up methods (e.g., credit card, mobile wallets) and logging them correctly.


### Functions for Managing Top-Ups
Several SQL queries are designed to handle different top-up operations. Let's walk through them and their use cases:

### 1. CreateTopUp

```sql
-- name: CreateTopup :one
INSERT INTO topups (user_id, topup_no, topup_amount, topup_method, topup_time)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)
RETURNING *;
```

This query inserts a new top-up record for a user. It records the user_id, the top-up number, the amount, the method used, and the time the top-up occurred.

- **Example Use Case**: A user adds funds to their account using a mobile wallet, and the system creates a top-up record to track this transaction.

### 2. GetAllTopups

```sql
-- name: GetAllTopups :many
SELECT * FROM topups;
```

This query retrieves all top-up records from the database. It is useful for auditing, reporting, or administrative purposes where a summary of all user top-ups is required.

- **Example Use Case**: An admin views all top-up records to monitor system activity or detect suspicious top-up behavior.

### 3. GetTopupByUsers

```sql
-- name: GetTopupByUsers :many
SELECT * FROM topups WHERE user_id = $1;
```

This query retrieves all top-up records for a specific user, identified by their user_id. It's useful for showing a user their top-up history or auditing individual accounts.

- **Example Use Case**: A user wants to view all the top-ups they’ve made over the past year. This query will return all top-up records for that specific user.

### 4. GetTopupByUserId

```sql
-- name: GetTopupByUserId :one
SELECT * FROM topups WHERE topup_id = $1 LIMIT 1;
```

This query fetches a specific top-up record by the topup_id. It's useful when you need detailed information about a particular top-up.

- **Example Use Case**: A user questions a specific top-up transaction, and support needs to retrieve the transaction details using its unique top-up ID.


### 5. GetTopupById

```sql
-- name: GetTopupById :one
SELECT * FROM topups WHERE topup_id = $1;
```
This query also retrieves a specific top-up record using the topup_id, with a similar use case as GetTopupByUserId. It allows the system to return detailed information for further actions.

- **Example Use Case**: Used for retrieving a particular top-up record when validating user complaints or verifying transactions.


### 6. UpdateTopup

```sql
-- name: UpdateTopup :one
UPDATE topups
SET topup_amount = $1, topup_method = $2, topup_time = $3
WHERE topup_id = $4
RETURNING *;
```

This query updates an existing top-up record, allowing changes to be made to the amount, method, or time of the top-up. It’s typically used in cases of correction or updating transaction details.

- **Example Use Case**: A user or admin realizes a top-up amount was incorrectly recorded, and this query updates the top-up amount and time.

### 7. DeleteTopup

```sql
-- name: DeleteTopup :exec
DELETE FROM topups WHERE user_id = $1 RETURNING *;
```

This query deletes a top-up record for a specific user, typically used for cleanup or data correction purposes.

- **Example Use Case**: A user requests the deletion of their account, and as part of this process, the system removes their top-up records.


<hr />

### Case Study Walkthrough: Top-Up Process
Let’s go through an example of how the top-up process works in this payment gateway system.

#### Example Scenario: User Top-Up

1. **Step 1: User Initiates a Top-Up** A user decides to add funds to their account using a payment method such as a credit card or mobile wallet. They specify the amount and the payment method.

2. **Step 2: Insert Top-Up Record** The system inserts a new top-up record using the CreateTopup query. This stores details about the top-up, including the user’s ID, the amount they are adding, the method used, and the time of the transaction.

```sql
INSERT INTO topups (user_id, topup_no, topup_amount, topup_method, topup_time)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5)
RETURNING *;
```

- $1: The user_id of the person making the top-up.
- $2: The top-up number or transaction identifier.
- $3: The amount added during the top-up.
- $4: The method used (e.g., credit card, PayPal, etc.).
- $5: The time the top-up occurred.

3. **Step 3: Update User’s Balance** Once the top-up is recorded, the system needs to update the user’s balance. This is where the UpdateSaldoBalance query from the saldo management case study comes into play. The new total balance is calculated by adding the top-up amount to the current balance.

4. **Step 4: Confirmation** After the balance is updated, the system returns the updated top-up record to confirm that the funds have been added successfully.

## Case Study: Transfer Management in Payment Gateway
This case study focuses on the management of transfers in the payment gateway system. Transfers allow users to send money from one account to another within the system. Ensuring these transfers are processed efficiently and securely is crucial for maintaining user trust and system integrity.

### Problem Definition
The primary challenge in managing transfers is ensuring the transaction between users is handled correctly, with funds being deducted from the sender and credited to the receiver without discrepancies. Proper logging and tracking of these transfers is critical for both user transparency and system auditing.

### Key Challenges
1. **Atomicity**: Ensuring that both the debit from the sender and the credit to the receiver occur in a single transaction.
2. **Concurrency**: Handling multiple concurrent transfers to avoid race conditions and ensure account balances are updated consistently.
3. **Auditing**: Keeping track of all transfers, both incoming and outgoing, for users and administrators to audit.

- **Example Use Case**: A user initiates a transfer to send funds to another account. The system records the transaction and returns the new transfer record for confirmation.

#### 2. GetTransferById

```sql
-- name: GetTransferById :one
SELECT * FROM transfers WHERE transfer_id = $1;
```

This query retrieves a specific transfer record based on the transfer_id. It’s useful when specific transfer details need to be retrieved for review or auditing.

- **Example Use Case**: A user contacts support regarding a particular transfer. Using the transfer ID, the support team retrieves the transfer details.

#### 3. GetTransferByUsers

```sql
-- name: GetTransferByUsers :many
SELECT * FROM transfers WHERE transfer_from = $1 OR transfer_to = $1;
```

This query retrieves all transfers involving a specific user, whether they sent or received the funds. It provides a complete overview of the user’s transfer history.

- **Example Use Case**: A user wants to view all the transfers they have made or received over the past month. This query retrieves all such records.


#### 4. GetTransferByUserId

```sql
-- name: GetTransferByUserId :one
SELECT * FROM transfers WHERE transfer_from = $1 OR transfer_to = $1;
```

This query retrieves transfer records for a specific user, but it is designed to return a single record instead of multiple. It’s useful when only the latest or a specific transfer is needed.

- **Example Use Case**: The system retrieves a recent transfer for a user based on their ID for quick reference.


#### 5. GetAllTransfers

```sql
-- name: GetAllTransfers :many
SELECT * FROM transfers;
```

- **Example Use Case**: A user requests deletion of their account, and the system removes all transfer records associated with that user as part of the account removal process.

### Case Study Walkthrough: Transfer Process
Let’s consider an example of how the transfer process works in this payment gateway system.

#### Example Scenario: User-to-User Transfer
1. **Step 1: User Initiates Transfer** A user initiates a transfer to send funds to another account. The system records the sender, receiver, amount, and time of the transaction.

2. **Step 2: Insert Transfer Record** The system inserts a new transfer record using the CreateTransfer query.

```sql
INSERT INTO transfers (transfer_from, transfer_to, transfer_amount, transfer_time)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
RETURNING *;
```
- $1: The user_id of the person sending the funds (the sender).
- $2: The user_id of the person receiving the funds (the receiver).
- $3: The amount being transferred.
- $4: The time of the transfer.

3. **Step 3: Update User Balances** The system must deduct the amount from the sender’s balance and add it to the receiver’s balance. This requires two separate queries:

Deducting the amount from the sender using the UpdateSaldoBalance query from the saldo management case study.
Adding the amount to the receiver’s balance using a similar saldo update query.

4. **Step 4: Confirm Transfer** After the balances are updated, the system returns the new transfer record, confirming that the transaction was successful.

## Problem Statement

The Series problem involves working with substrings of a given string. Given an integer `n` and a string `s`, the task is to return:
1. All possible consecutive substrings of length `n` from the input string.
2. A function to return the first `n` characters from the string.

For example, given the string `s = "12345"` and `n = 3`, the series would be:
- `["123", "234", "345"]`

## Approach

To solve this problem:
- For generating all possible consecutive substrings, we need to iterate through the string and extract every substring of length `n`.
- For the `UnsafeFirst` function, simply extract the first `n` characters of the string.

### Algorithm

1. **All**:
   - Initialize an empty list to hold the substrings.
   - Loop through the string with a sliding window of size `n`.
   - Append each substring of length `n` to the result list.
   
2. **UnsafeFirst**:
   - Return the first `n` characters of the string.

### Implementation in Go

```go
package series

func All(n int, s string) []string {
    ans := []string{}
	for i := 0; i <= len(s) - n; i++ {
        ans = append(ans, s[i:i+n])
    }
	return ans
}

func UnsafeFirst(n int, s string) string {
	return s[:n]
}
```

## Explanation
    - **All**:

        - The function takes an integer n and a string s.
        - It loops from the start of the string until len(s) - n + 1 to extract all substrings of length n.
        - Each substring is appended to the result list.

    - **UnsafeFirst**:

        - This function simply returns the first n characters from the string s.
        - It's called "unsafe" because it doesn't handle cases where n is greater than the length of the string, which could lead to runtime errors.
    
    For Example:

    ```go
    s := "12345"
    n := 3
    All(n, s) // Returns: ["123", "234", "345"]
    UnsafeFirst(n, s) // Returns: "123"

    ```

### Time and Space Complexity

    - **Time Complexity**: O((len(s) - n) * n) for the All function, since it involves slicing the string multiple times and appending results.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(len(s)) for storing the output slices.

### Edge Cases
    - The length n should be less than or equal to the length of the string.
    If n is larger than the string length in UnsafeFirst, it could cause a panic due to out-of-bounds slicing.

## Conclusion
The Series problem can be efficiently solved using basic string slicing in Go. By looping over the string to generate substrings and using simple slice operations, the task is performed with linear complexity. The All function provides flexibility in generating all substrings, while UnsafeFirst returns the first segment of the string.

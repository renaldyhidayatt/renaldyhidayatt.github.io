## Introduction

Preparing for technical interviews requires familiarity with a range of algorithms and data structures. This guide will introduce you to some of the most commonly encountered topics in coding interviews, along with examples and practical advice on how to approach problems in each area.

## Key Categories of Algorithms and Data Structures

### 1. **Dynamic Programming (1D_DP/)**

Dynamic programming (DP) is a technique for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is commonly used for optimization problems and involves storing solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

- **Example Problems**: Fibonacci sequence, climbing stairs, coin change.
- **Interview Tip**: Recognize DP problems by identifying overlapping subproblems. If a problem has recursive structure and asks for the "minimum" or "maximum" way to do something, DP might be a good fit.

### 2. **Array and String Manipulation (array_string/)**

Arrays and strings are fundamental data structures and appear frequently in interview questions. Understanding efficient ways to traverse, modify, and search within arrays and strings is essential.

- **Example Problems**: Reverse a string, find duplicates, rotate an array.
- **Interview Tip**: Mastering basic operations on arrays and strings is crucial. For example, try to solve problems in place (without extra space) when possible to improve efficiency.

### 3. **Backtracking (backtracking/)**

Backtracking is a problem-solving approach that involves building up a solution incrementally and abandoning it if it turns out to be invalid (like in puzzles and combinatorial problems).

- **Example Problems**: Sudoku solver, N-Queens, permutations.
- **Interview Tip**: Recognize backtracking problems by looking for constraints and solutions that involve exploring combinations or permutations. Often used in recursive algorithms.

### 4. **Binary Search (binary_search/)**

Binary search is a powerful technique for searching sorted arrays or data, allowing you to find elements in `O(log n)` time. It’s used in various scenarios, from finding specific values to implementing efficient search functions.

- **Example Problems**: Find an element in a sorted array, search for the first/last occurrence of a number.
- **Interview Tip**: Use binary search when you’re working with sorted data. Understand variants, like binary search on the answer, which is used in optimization problems.

### 5. **Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (binary-tree-general/, binary_search_tree/)**

Binary trees and binary search trees are hierarchical data structures with a variety of applications, from database indexing to file storage. Binary search trees (BSTs) are binary trees with the added property that all left descendants are less than the node and all right descendants are greater.

- **Example Problems**: Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder), find the minimum/maximum in a BST.
- **Interview Tip**: Practice tree traversal methods and recognize when to use recursive vs. iterative solutions.

### 6. **Bit Manipulation (bit_manipulation/)**

Bit manipulation involves operations at the bit level, making it useful for tasks requiring optimized memory usage or certain mathematical computations.

- **Example Problems**: Counting the number of 1-bits, swapping numbers without extra space.
- **Interview Tip**: Bit manipulation is common in low-level programming. Know operations like AND, OR, XOR, left shift, and right shift.

### 7. **Divide and Conquer (divide_conquer/)**

Divide and conquer is an algorithmic technique that involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each independently, and combining their solutions. It’s commonly used in sorting and search algorithms.

- **Example Problems**: Merge sort, quick sort, finding the median of two sorted arrays.
- **Interview Tip**: Think of divide and conquer for problems where you can split data into smaller parts and solve each part individually.

### 8. **Graphs (graph_bfs/, graph_general/)**

Graphs represent relationships and connections between elements. Graph algorithms are used in problems like pathfinding, connectivity, and network flow.

- **Example Problems**: Breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), shortest path.
- **Interview Tip**: Be familiar with graph representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix) and key algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s).

### 9. **Hash Maps (hashmap/)**

Hash maps (or hash tables) allow fast data retrieval using key-value pairs. They’re essential for handling lookups, counts, and grouping.

- **Example Problems**: Counting elements, checking for duplicates, anagram grouping.
- **Interview Tip**: Hash maps are great for storing and retrieving data quickly. Understand collision resolution and handling duplicate keys.

### 10. **Heap (heap/)**

Heaps are a type of binary tree used to maintain a dynamic set of elements where you want to quickly retrieve the minimum or maximum element.

- **Example Problems**: Finding the `k` largest/smallest elements, median finder.
- **Interview Tip**: Min-heaps and max-heaps are particularly useful for priority queues. Many languages have built-in support for heaps.

### 11. **Intervals (intervals/)**

Problems involving intervals require finding overlaps or merging ranges. These are common in scheduling and range queries.

- **Example Problems**: Merge intervals, insert interval, meeting room scheduling.
- **Interview Tip**: Sorting intervals often simplifies the solution, allowing you to handle overlaps in one pass.

### 12. **Kadane’s Algorithm (kadane_algorithm/)**

Kadane’s Algorithm is a specific dynamic programming approach for finding the maximum subarray sum in an array.

- **Example Problems**: Maximum subarray, maximum product subarray.
- **Interview Tip**: Recognize Kadane’s Algorithm when dealing with problems that require finding maximum contiguous subarrays.

### 13. **Linked Lists (linked_list/)**

Linked lists are a sequential data structure where each element points to the next. They’re used in scenarios where data elements need dynamic insertion or removal.

- **Example Problems**: Reverse a linked list, detect cycles, merge two sorted lists.
- **Interview Tip**: Practice linked list operations (insertion, deletion, reversal) and understand the benefits of singly vs. doubly linked lists.

### 14. **Math and Number Theory (math_leetcode/)**

Mathematics problems test your understanding of number properties and mathematical algorithms. Common questions involve primes, factors, or modular arithmetic.

- **Example Problems**: Prime factorization, greatest common divisor, power calculation.
- **Interview Tip**: Be familiar with mathematical concepts like modular arithmetic and prime number detection.

### 15. **Matrix (matrix/)**

Matrices are 2D arrays with a variety of applications. Problems here often involve grid-based traversal or manipulation.

- **Example Problems**: Rotate matrix, search in a 2D matrix, island counting.
- **Interview Tip**: Visualize traversal strategies and understand when to use DFS or BFS for matrix problems.

### 16. **Sliding Window (sliding_window/)**

Sliding window is a technique for problems involving subarrays or substrings. It’s particularly useful for finding maximums, minimums, or checking conditions within a fixed-size window.

- **Example Problems**: Maximum sum subarray, longest substring without repeating characters.
- **Interview Tip**: This technique is great for continuous subarray or substring questions where you need to find optimal ranges.

### 17. **Stacks and Queues (stack/)**

Stacks and queues are linear data structures with different constraints on how elements are accessed. They’re useful for sequential data and problems involving recent or oldest data.

- **Example Problems**: Valid parentheses, evaluate postfix expressions, browser history.
- **Interview Tip**: Remember that stacks are LIFO (last in, first out), while queues are FIFO (first in, first out).

### 18. **Tries (trie/)**

Tries are tree structures used to store strings and words. They are particularly useful in search applications like autocomplete and dictionary lookups.

- **Example Problems**: Word search, autocomplete, longest prefix.
- **Interview Tip**: Know the structure of a Trie and how to efficiently insert, delete, and search words.

### 19. **Two Pointers (two_pointer/)**

The two-pointer technique is useful in array and string problems where you need to compare or track two elements.

- **Example Problems**: Two-sum sorted array, container with most water, palindrome checking.
- **Interview Tip**: This technique is great for problems where you can work with two ends of a range or list simultaneously.

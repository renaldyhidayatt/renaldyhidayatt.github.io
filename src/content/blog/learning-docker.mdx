## Docker Basics + Cheatsheet

### Introduction

**Docker** is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in isolated environments called containers. Containers package up an application and all of its dependencies, ensuring that it works uniformly across different computing environments.

This guide will cover Docker’s core concepts, how to install it, and provide a **cheatsheet** to help you get started and manage containers quickly.


### Prerequisites

Before you dive into Docker, ensure you have:

- **Basic Linux/Unix commands** knowledge.
- A **64-bit operating system** with virtualization enabled.

### Installing Docker

Docker is available for multiple operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Here’s how to install it on different platforms:

#### For macOS:
```bash
brew install --cask docker
```

#### For Linux(Ubuntu):

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# Install Docker Engine:
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

#### Running Docker:

```bash 
docker run hello-world
```


### Key Docker Concepts
    - **Image**: A Docker image is a blueprint for containers. It includes the application code, libraries, dependencies, and environment settings.
    - **Container**: A lightweight, executable package of software that contains everything needed to run the application.
    - **Dockerfile**: A text file that contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image.
    - **Docker Hub**: A public registry that hosts Docker images for download.


### Docker Cheatsheet

#### Basic Docker commands

```bash
docker --version          # Check Docker version
docker info               # Get system-wide information about Docker
```

#### Working with images:

```bash
docker images                        # List all images
docker pull <image-name>             # Download an image from Docker Hub
docker rmi <image-name>              # Remove an image
```

#### Running Containers:

```bash
docker run <image-name>              # Run a container from an image
docker run -it <image-name> bash     # Run a container with an interactive terminal
docker run -d <image-name>           # Run container in detached mode (background)
docker run -p 8080:80 <image-name>   # Map container port 80 to local port 8080
docker ps                            # List running containers
docker stop <container-id>           # Stop a running container
docker rm <container-id>             # Remove a stopped container
```

#### Container Management:

```bash
docker logs <container-id>           # View logs of a container
docker exec -it <container-id> bash  # Run commands inside a running container
docker inspect <container-id>        # Detailed information about a container
docker stats <container-id>          # Monitor container resource usage
```

#### Volumes and Data Persistence:

```bash
docker volume create <volume-name>           # Create a volume
docker run -v <volume-name>:/data <image>    # Mount a volume to a container
docker volume ls                             # List all Docker volumes
docker volume rm <volume-name>               # Remove a volume
```

#### Docker Networking

```bash
docker network ls                # List all Docker networks
docker network create <name>     # Create a custom network
docker network inspect <name>    # Get detailed info about a network
docker run --network=<name> <image>   # Run container on a specific network
```


#### Clean Up docker Resource


```bash
docker system prune -f           # Remove all unused containers, images, and networks
docker container prune -f        # Remove stopped containers
docker image prune -f            # Remove unused images
```

## Example: Building and Running a Dockerized Go Application

Let’s walk through building and running a basic Go application with Docker.

### 1. Create a Simple Go Application

Create a simple Go application in a file named `main.go`:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, Dockerized Go!")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    fmt.Println("Server starting at :8080")
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

### 2. Create a Dockerfile

Create a Dockerfile in your project root:

```dockerfile
# Start from the official Go image
FROM golang:1.20

# Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy go.mod and go.sum files to the workspace
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download dependencies
RUN go mod download

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the Go application
RUN go build -o main .

# Expose port 8080 to the outside world
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the executable
CMD ["./main"]
```

### 3. Build the Image

In the same directory as your Dockerfile, run the following command to build your Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-go-app .
```
This command will create a new `Docker` image named my-go-app using the instructions from your `Dockerfile`.


### 4. Run the Image

In the same directory as your Dockerfile, run the following command to run your Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-go-app
```

### 5. Look at Logs

In the same directory as your Dockerfile, run the following command to view the logs of your Docker image:

```bash
docker logs my-go-app
```

### 6. Clean Up

In the same directory as your Dockerfile, run the following command to remove your Docker image:

```bash

docker rmi my-go-app
```

### 7. Stop the Image

In the same directory as your Dockerfile, run the following command to stop the Docker image:

```bash

docker stop my-go-app
```

## Conclusion
**Docker** is a powerful tool for creating, managing, and shipping applications in containers. Whether you're developing locally, testing, or deploying to production, Docker simplifies the process by providing a consistent environment for your app to run in.

Use the above cheatsheet to quickly get started with Docker commands and feel free to explore Docker Compose for more complex, multi-container setups!
